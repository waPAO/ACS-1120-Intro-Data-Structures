## Activities

- Compare code quality for histogram implementations
- Refactor code to improve readability, modularity, and performance
- Compare tradeoffs of different histogram implementations

  - Watch [video of histogram comparison whiteboard activity]

- Lecture and discussion following [probability and sampling slides]

  - Watch [video of probability and sampling lecture]

## Objectives

After completing this class session and the associated tutorial challenges, students will be able to ...

- Sample words according to their observed frequencies
- Compare tradeoffs with different sampling techniques
- Validate sampling techniques based on relative probabilities

## Challenges

These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project and course. Be sure to complete these before next class session and before starting on the stretch challenges below.

- [Page 4: Stochastic Sampling]

  - Sample words by observed frequency weighting
  - Test relative probabilities to validate sampling technique

## Stretch Challenges

These challenges are more difficult and help you push your skills and understanding to the next level.

- [Page 4: Stochastic Sampling]

  - Optimize for speed of sampling (read time)
  - Optimize for memory (use the least amount of space)
  - Solve with only lists and tuples
  - Combine other weighting techniques

## Resources

- Review Make School's [probability and sampling slides]
- Consult Python's [random module] documentation, but _do not_ use the `random.choices` function (the challenge is to implement this yourself)
- If you're _really_ stuck, read the Python Cookbook's [Randomly Picking Items with Given Probabilities], but _don't read this until you've tried to solve it yourself_
