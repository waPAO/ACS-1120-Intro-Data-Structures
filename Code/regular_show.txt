Mordecai and Rigby: OOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHH!!! (Benson walks in, carrying mail)

Benson: Bill......bill......(finds a coupon) oohh, Bedtopia coupon! (he waves it around) Papa needs a new comforter! (winks and makes a clicking noise) You guys got a couple things too (hands Mordecai and Rigby two green envelopes)

Rigby: Man Benson, do that with a little less drama next time. (looks at envelope and passes one to Mordecai)

Mordecai: (takes envelope) Yeah, why can't you be more like the mail guys on T.V.?

Benson: Because....(facepalms) *sigh* (nods) I don't know (walks away)

Mordecai: Woah dude, check it out. (shows front of envelope) A square eeennveloooooppppee!

Eileen: (looks at Rigby's) Hand-caligraphed addresses?! (waves hand by face) Wooooh, things just got fancy in here!

Mordecai: (reading the invitation) Traffic's at a standstill due to a massive back up at the Smith residence.

Rigby: (continues reading the invitation) Some minor congestion is expected at the intersection of cake, fancy sodas, and a good time, as we celebrate the 1000th flight of Chopper 6.

Mordecai: (continues) We're not seeing any delays of an RSVP for you and one guest. (They both look confused, not knowing what its saying)

Rigby: (after a couple seconds) ....OH! It's a party, for Margaret's dad's 1000th ride on Chopper 6!

Eileen: And CJ and I can go too, right guys?! (Mordecai and CJ look worried)

Mordecai: Uuuuuuh......(Mordecai looks at CJ, looking nervous)

CJ: Oh! *clears throat* I promised some friends I'd volunteer at this river clean up thing that day.

Mordecai: Oh, well.......(everyone is silent for a moment)

CJ: (seeming a little frantic)......Just go without me! It sounds like it'll be really fun.

Rigby: OH *sighs in relief* 'Cause if you were there, and Margaret was there....(shudders in disgust) (fastly) Probably a lot less awkward this way-(gets punched by Mordecai) OW! DUDE! I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING WE DON'T ALREADY KNOW!

CJ: Rigby's right, go, have fun (smiles).

Mordecai: (kind of in disbelief) Really?

CJ: I trust you.

Mordecai: (hugs her, extremely happy) AAAAAAAWWWHH! (pulls away a bit) I'll bring you a piece a' cake from the party for being the coolest girlfriend ever (they kiss)

(Scene cuts to Margaret's parent's house. They party is taking place in the backyard. Darrell and Robby, two of Margaret's cousins, are shown playing with two remote control helicopter toys. They make them collide into one another and they crash on the ground.)

Robby: (shooting and crashing noises while the helicopters crash) Chopper 6 down, Chopper 6 down!

Darrell: Hehehehehe (Then Denise walks by, holding a tray of drinks)

Denise: (scolding) That's not funny kids! (Mordecai, Rigby, and Eileen then walk in through the back gate)

Mordecai: Hi!

Denise: Oh hey guys! Glad you could make it. Ugh, can you believe it?! Margaret's still at work! She might not even make it at all!

Mordecai: (gets happy and smiles) Oooohh, bummer.

Denise: (sternly) You're smiling.

Mordecai: (stops smiling) Sorry, cheek cramp. (Then one of the remote control helicopters, the white one, crashes into the punch bowl)

Denise: (aggravated) Darrell, COME ON! You almost ruined our special order cake here!

Rigby: (The three look down at the cake on the table next to the bowl) That's a cake?!

Mordecai: CJ's gotta see this (He pulls out his phone and takes a picture of it. A second later, Frank can be heard)

Frank: Mordecai!

Mordecai: (looks up) Huh? Mr. Smith! (Frank walks over with Jackie Carmichael. He shakes Mordecai's hand, then gives him a hug. Mordecai is caught off guard by this) awwh..ehh!

Frank: (pulls away) Hahahaha! (pats his back) Want ya to meet my long time partner in the skies, Jackie Carmichael!

Jackie Carmichael: (elbows Frank) What a day, huh? I can't wait to find out who's gonna get that coveted extra seat in the 1000th Chopper flight!

Eileen: Extra seat?

Frank: There's one for my wife, one for my daughter, and one wild card!

Jackie Carmichael: (shrugs) Sure would mean a lot! Even more than the award I won for being the top traffic reporter in the city.

Denise: (pops up behind Frank and holds onto his chest, Jackie looks surprised) Frank has a lot of important people in his life, Jackie. Isn't that right Frank?

Frank: That's true hon. (Jackie gets angry and jealous and walks away) Haven't made up my mind yet about that extra seat.

Rigby: Have you considered your daughter's ex-boyfriend's best friend?

Mordecai: He's not gonna take you Rigby. (to Frank) Sorry. (slowly) Hey, do you mind if I get a piece of cake for CJ?

Frank: CJ?

Rigby: She's Mordecai's new girlfriend. Not totally new, but newer than Margaret. (Mordecai shoots Rigby an angry glare, then looks back at Frank)

Frank: (appears angry) *sigh* (Margaret then shows up through the back gate with the camera crew. She is reporting about her dad's party)

Margaret: Here we are now at the celebration of Frank Smith's 1000th chopper ride. (turns toward the party) Looks like quite a turn out! (Eileen waves at her)

Frank: (arms spread out) Hugbug, you came!

Margaret: (also has arms spread out) 'Course I did! (they hug, then pull apart. Frank's hand is on her shoulder)

Mordecai: Hi Margaret.

Margaret: Hi!

Frank: (Frank puts his other hand on Mordecai's shoulder and brings him in. He's got a mischevious look on his face. Mordecai looks worried) Your friend Mordecai here was just saying he has a new girlfriend named CJ.

Margaret: *scoffs* (looks embarrassed) Dad!

Mordecai: (gets uncomfortable) I, uh, have to go to the bathroom (runs away)

Rigby: Oh no. Dude, wait up! (runs after him)

Frank: ...Got any new hobbies, Eileen?

Eileen: Yeah, I do

(Scene now cuts to Mordecai in the bathroom. He's leaning on the sink, texting CJ. He sends the picture of the cake with the caption "Chopper Cake!". CJ sends back a smiley face, and texts back "River still super dirty but hope party's fun!" and a picture of her with a dirty bra and a disgusted look on her face.)

Mordecai: Hehe, gross. (Then someone knocks on the door, its Rigby)

Rigby: (only his voice is heard) You're being weird, Mordecai!

Mordecai: That's fine.

Rigby: (scene shows Rigby outside the door) Come ooon! You have to come out of the bathroom.

Mordecai: No I don't. Margaret's out there, so if I stay here then I won't mess things up. This is the choice of maturity.

Rigby: (only his voice) What about the cake?

Mordecai: (facepalms) Ugh, the cake. (Looks up and sighs) I'll come out when they cut the cake and then I'll leave.

Rigby: (showing him at the door) That's dumb dude! CJ told you to have fun! Just come out here, and I'll stick by you so nothing happens with Margaret. Then you can grab the cake, and better yet, your dignity. (Mordecai opens the door, Rigby smiles)

Mordecai: You'll stay with me the whole time?

Rigby: Or until you actually have to go to the bathroom.

Mordecai: Thanks Rigby. (Rigby punches Mordecai. Mordecai looks really hurt) AHH! OW! (rubs arm)

Rigby: (frustrated expression) That's payback, for punching me on the couch! Let's go. (they start to walk)

Mordecai: (complaining) That was a really long time ago!

(A montage is then shown, in which Rigby "protects" Mordecai from "pulling a Mordecai". The two are seen talking to John, until they notice Margaret approaching. Rigby quickly eats a plateful of deviled eggs and shoves the plate towards Margaret. Rigby gives her a nervous smile, Margaret looks annoyed and walks away. Mordecai looks sad, while Rigby smirks to Mordecai, then holds his stomach. Next, Mordecai, Rigby, and Eileen are signing their names on the "Happy 1000th Chopper Flight" banner. Margaret is at the end of the table next to Mordecai. She smiles at him, then Mordecai looks at her nervously and looks at Rigby. Rigby quickly draws a line with his marker all the way to Margaret and sticks his rear towards her. She looks disgusted and walks away. Mordecai and Rigby have the same expressions as last time. Finally, Mordecai and Rigby are spinning Eileen around, playing "Pin the Tail on the Chopper". They stop spinning her and she walks towards the poster. Margaret walks behind Mordecai and Rigby, until two of her cousins run into her, causing her to bump into Mordecai. They look at each other, Margaret with an apologetic look and Mordecai with a fake, nervous smile. Rigby looks at them nervously and quickly grabs one of Margaret's cousins and shoves him towards Margaret. Margaret angrily looks at him, but he points towards Rigby. She looks at Rigby, but is too late because Mordecai and Rigby run away. Meanwhile, Eileen successfully pins the tail on the chopper and takes off her blind fold. She happily looks towards Mordecai and Rigby, but seeing that they left, is sad. All she sees is a blurred Margaret. Then the montage ends with Frank about to give a speech)

Frank: *clears throat* I'd like to say a few words before we cut the cake.

Mordecai: (looks at Rigby, both are smiling) Caaake.

Frank: (continues) (slowly) Chopper 6, Chopper 6, Chopper 6. (Normally) How many times have I said those words? Well at least nine hundred and ninety-nine plus the three just now, heh. It's been such an honor to patrol the skies so the people know which highways have less traffic and more car chases, (winks and points at someone) but I couldn't have done it alone.

Jackie Carmichael: (gives a huge smile)

Frank: I'd like to thank my baby girl Margaret, and my beautiful wife Denise (pats chest), for emotionally always being next to me in the Chopper (Margaret and Denise are shown standing next to each other. Jackie is a couple feet behind them, giving an angry expression) (points to the sky) Today I'd like for them to literally be next to me in the Chopper. Everyone else, please grab a slice of cake (gestures towards the cake) and join us in the front yard, while we make history! (Cuts the cake)

(Scene cuts to the front yard, where Margaret and Denise get into the chopper. Jackie is seen desperately getting to Frank, shoving past other people)

Jackie Carmichael: Frank! FRANK! (smiles) Aren't you forgetting somethin'?

Frank: Oh, right! The extra seat, heh. How can I forget?

Jackie Carmichael: (Jackie is so sure its her, that she begins to climb into the chopper) Aw, don't worry about it.

Frank: I reserved this seat for a very special person.

Mordecai: (Scene then shows Mordecai picking out a piece of cake for CJ, with Frank and the chopper in the background) Hmm......oh-(he's cut off by Frank)

Frank: Mordecai! (Mordecai looks surprised)

Jackie Carmichael: (gets off of the chopper).....Mordecai?

Mordecai: (turns towards the chopper) I, uh...

Jackie Carmichael: *scoffs* Nevermind that I won an award and I still don't get respect around here. (mumbling while walking away) These awards don't get anything for me.....(leaves)

Frank: (walks towards Mordecai) Sorry it got heated before. It's hard for me to accept that you and Margaret aren't together.

Mordecai: That's ok.

Frank: NO, it's not ok! You're family Mordecai...at least I consider you family. And I always will, whether or not you and Margaret are a couple.

Mordecai: Um...(looks down and sees the cakes are going fast) (slowly) Well...thank you...for that. (Frank then shoves a helmet towards Mordecai) OOF!

Frank: Haha! (puts hand on shoulder, Mordecai looks uncomfortable) Now go grab a piece of cake for your girlfriend JC before it disappears. 'Cause the flight of a lifetime's about to take off! (walks away)

Mordecai: (grabs a piece of cake, Rigby appears, already stuffing his face) Hey Rigby, can I trust you to hold this piece of cake for me without eating it?

Rigby: Dude...(shrugs) its cake!

Mordecai: *sighs* Never mind. (walks to the chopper and goes on it. The chopper takes off. The chopper shakes, causing the cake to almost fall off the plate) (nervously) Woooaah, WOOOAAUUGGH! (he gets icing on his wing) Ugh.

Margaret: (points at the mess) Should've brought a napkin, too huh?

Mordecai: (awkward speaking gibberish) Aaauugghh......

Margaret: (continues) How are things at the Park?

Mordecai: (continues speaking gibberish) (looking all around) Nnnnhh...aaaaOOUUHH! (the open door of the Chopper is shown)

Margaret: (notices the awkwardness) Dude!

Mordecai: UUUUUUGGGGHHHH!

Margaret: Why are you being so weird? I know a lot's happened, but I thought we were cool now?

Mordecai: Yeah......(looks down) no, it's still weird.

Margaret: (frustrated) Well what's it gonna take?! (puts hands in air) This is a party! (happier) We're on Chopper 6's THOUSANDTH ride! Can't we just try to have fun like we used to?

Mordecai: Yeah, I guess you're right. (Makes radio noises) We had a six car pile up around Christmas, but now we're not seeing any delays as we make our way north through the clouds.

Mordecai and Margaret: Hahahaha!

Frank: (at the driver's seat) That's some solid traffic reporting son! Where'd ya learn that?

Denise: Aw Frank! (to Mordecai and Margaret) He thinks it takes skill to do what he does.

Mordecai and Margaret: (look at each other) Hahahaha!

(Back on the ground, everyone watches the chopper fly in the air. Rigby and Eileen are standing there, watching as well)

Eileen: (while holding a piece of cake) How long are we supposed to watch it? (Just then CJ shows up)

CJ: Guess I missed the launch? (both face towards her)

Rigby: CJ!

Eileen: Oh cool, you made it! What happened at the river clean up?

CJ: They send us home after someone got chemical burns from the water. (Look around) Where's Mordecai? (Eileen points to the chopper, CJ looks up and sees Mordecai and Margaret laughing together)....Mordecai? (they keep laughing as the chopper flies around in a circle in its one spot)

Mordecai: (looks out and sees CJ on the ground, looking devastated) *gasp* Uhh...I can't be here, I-I gotta hang with CJ. (Tries to take off his seat belt. Margaret looks at him, worried. He takes off his seat belt and stands up) (yelling) CJ! Hi! (the chopper jerks, making Mordecai lose balance and fall on Margaret's lap. CJ gets angry)

CJ: Aw, come on! (turns grey) Did you think I wouldn't find out?! That you could just make a fool of me forever?! (Turns into a full on stormcloud and flies towards the chopper) This is the LAST TIME! (As CJ threatens, the camera crew is recording the whole thing)

Guy: Are you getting this Glen? (They run towards the scene)

CJ: (blows some wind) RRRRRRRRUUUUUUUUUUGGGHHHHH! (Amongst the chaos, she blows Robby and Darrell's toy helicopters and they're slammed into the camera crew. She continues her rampage, shaking the chopper like crazy) RRRRRRAAAAAAAUUUUUUUGGGGGHHHHH!!!

Mordecai: (Yelling above the wind) CJ, it's not what you think! There was an extra seat!

Frank: (yelling) Is everyone ok back there?!

Denise: (only her voice, painfully hurt, also yelling) We're fine-OOF!

Margaret: (only her voice, yelling) MOM!!

Mordecai: (only his voice, yelling) Woah, are you ok?!

Frank: (presses a bunch of buttons, putting on autopilot and joins the others, angry) What's with your new girlfriend Mordecai?!

Mordecai: (worried) I don't know! I guess we're having another misunderstanding?

Frank: (still angry) No son of mine would bring this to my 1000th Chopper Flight Party!

Mordecai: But I'm not your son!

(CJ starts to shoot lightning and shakes the chopper more. This causes Frank and Denise to fall out of the chopper, holding onto each other)

Frank and Denise: aaaaAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!

Margaret: (scared and frantic) MOM! DAD! (takes off her seat belt)

Frank: (yelling) You're right to be concerned, Margaret but it's gonna be ok! I'm a professional! (to Denise) Grab your knees hon.

Frank and Denise: MANNONBALL!! (they land in the pool, but look like they have broken bones)

Denise: It really does take skill to do what you do.

Mordecai: (Mordecai and Margaret are still in the Chopper, with CJ still creating her storm. Margaret is calming herself down and taking deep breaths after almost losing her parents) It's ok, they made it.

Margaret: Yeah, but what about us?

(CJ continues to cause trouble. She strikes lightning near the Smith house, and everyone runs away)

Mordecai: CJ, please! (He stumbles and accidentally shoves the cake into Margaret's mouth. CJ gets even MORE angry at this. She shakes the chopper again, which cuts some of a tree. Margaret falls down and grabs an air horn. She then almost falls out of the chopper)

Margaret: AAAHH!!

Mordecai: MARGARET, NOOO! (he then throws the plate and whatever is left of the cake out of the chopper. Margaret grabs onto the chopper's bar with one wing. CJ gets mad because the cake plummets down to the ground)

CJ: (She strikes the chopper with more lightning) RRRRRRRRAAAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHH!!!!!!!!

Mordecai: CJ, LISTEN TO ME, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK!!! REALLY!!!

Margaret: (using the air horn) MORDECAI IS TELLING YOU THE TRUTH! HE'S TOLD YOU THE TRUTH, LIKE, A HUNDRED TIMES! WE'RE. JUST. FRIENDS!!

CJ: WHY SHOULD I TRUST YOU?!

Margaret: (angry) BECAUSE! I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!

Mordecai: (hurt).......You have a boyfriend?

Frank: (disappointed) You have a boyfriend?!

CJ: (slowly realizing) YOU.....have..a boyfriend??

Margaret: (still using air horn) Look! He just showed up!

Del Hanlon: (locks car) Yowsa! Should've grabbed my windbreaker off the sailboat!

Rigby: (amazed) Weekend sports anchor Del Hanlon?!

Del Hanlon: Hey Eileen! (Rigby's surprised he knows Eileen)

Eileen: Hey! (Rigby looks at her, surprised)

Del Hanlon: Heeeeeyy Margaret!

Mordecai: (looks shocked, turns around and shuts his eyes) uuuuggghhh...

Margaret: There's nothing to be upset about here!

CJ: (still in storm cloud mode) But....you...so you don't....? (She slowly retracts into her normal form) (ashamed) ....Oh no....(covers face)

Mordecai: (flips the switch labeled "auto land" on. The chopper lands, and Margaret gets off)

Margaret: (waves) Hey Del!

Del Hanlon: Margaret (they quickly hug)

Margaret: All the cake's gone, but we still have some snacks.

Del Hanlon: Oooh, that's ok. I don't pollute my body with refined sugar anyway.

Mordecai: (looks at them and half smiles. He picks up what is left of the cake. Soft, mellow music plays) *sighs*

CJ: *sniff*, *soft crying*

Mordecai: ....CJ?

CJ: (slow, depressed tone, has her back to him) I'm not really in the mood for cake, right now.

Mordecai: I'm sorry. I mean, I did what you asked me to do, so.....but then...

CJ: Don't. (Turns towards him) This time it was my fault. Margaret's parents almost died because I freaked out about nothing!

Mordecai: Yeah....that did happen.

CJ: (about to break down) *sniff* I have to go! *sniff* *soft crying*

(Mordecai turns around and watches her go. He is joined by Margaret, Del, Rigby, and Eileen)

Rigby: (gesturing towards the cake) Dude, is it cool if I eat the rest of that? (Mordecai just gives it to him. The soft music keeps playing as the whole mess is shown)

Employee: Movies! Rent your movies! (Rigby rushes out of the store, carrying a movie case. He bumps into the employee.) Oh, sorry man.

Rigby: (chuckling) Nice outfit. (runs off)

Employee: It's a costume! They make me wear it!

(cut to the house. It's nighttime, and Mordecai and Rigby are ready to watch the movie.)

Mordecai: Movie night! (holds up a bowl of popcorn.) I got the popcorn!

Rigby: (holding up the movie, showing only the backside) I got the movie!

Mordecai: Wait, I thought we were watching Shy Guy. (He holds up the movie. The case is pink and has a big red heart on it.)

Rigby: Dude, you've seen that movie 100 times. I got something better. BAM! (shows the movie to Mordecai. It's called "Ello Gov'nor," and it has a picture of an evil British Taxi on the cover.)

Mordecai: Ello Gov'nor?

Rigby: Yeah, man, it's foreign. Check it. (reading the back) "A British taxi is possessed by the soul of its driver, seeking revenge on the lowly gang members who murdered him. Pay the fare... ( pops head from behind case) ...or pay the price."

Mordecai: No, dude, not another horror movie. Last time I had to walk you to the bathroom every night for a week.

Rigby: No, man, it'll be different. This one is old and cheesy. It will be hilarious.

Mordecai: You sure you can handle it?

Rigby: Dude, it's in black and white. Come on.

Mordecai: Mmm... alright.

(Rigby opens the case for the movie, and Mordecai turns off the light. Rigby puts the tape into the VCR, and the movie begins playing, with ominous music. The card reads, "ELLO GOV'NOR, (c) MCMLXXXII." M&R fake screaming, but laugh pretty quickly.)

Rigby: See, isn't this fun?

Mordecai: Hmph. Hmph.

(Now, we're in the movie. It starts at a boarding school. In the classroom, a boy sits quietly and opens his composition notebook to see a tire print engraved in it. He gasps, and then looks out the window to see the taxi.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(The taxi drives into the window, and, off-screen, runs him over. Mordecai laughs a little, but Rigby seems like he is scared. In the next scene of the movie, a woman is in her bathroom combing her hair. She closes the cabinet, and, in the mirror, we can see the taxi behind the shower curtain.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(She turns around and sees the British taxi come out of her shower, which runs her over off-screen. Mordecai yawns with boredom, and Rigby is scared, holding a pillow. In the movie, an old man is walking his dog, and hears the taxi's engine. It's standing behind him.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(The old man tries to run away, but he gets hit. Rigby watches in horror as the taxi eats him. He's also sweating hard.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(The taxi spits out some of the man's bones from the engine and later, it's killing more people.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

(More screaming occurs before the movie ends and the screen goes to static. Mordecai snores before immediately waking up.)

Mordecai: Huh? Is it over? (He turns off the TV and rubs his eyes) Dude, that was so cheesy. I mean, what was up with the taxi? Was it supposed to be evil or normal but haunted by a ghost... (Rigby looks freaked out by the movie) ...controlling the taxi or what? You know?

(Fade in to their room. Mordecai is peacefully asleep while Rigby trying to go to sleep. He gets up and looks through the window. He sees no taxi at first, but when he looks at the same spot again, it's there.)

Rigby: Mordecai!

(Mordecai is still asleep. Rigby turns around and sees the British taxi right by his window. He screams and runs to Mordecai.)

Rigby: (shakes Mordecai) Mordecai! Wake up! Wake up!

Mordecai: (in taxi's voice) Ello, gov'nor! (turns around to show that his eyes are lit up like carlights.)

(Rigby screams and step back. Mordecai sits up and the British taxi comes out of his body and comes toward Rigby before nightmare ends. Rigby wakes up, screaming, until he gets hit by a pillow thrown by Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a freaking maniac! (In the UK, the line is "Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a flipping maniac!" In Australia, the line is changed to "Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a maniac!". However, for some people in Australia, the line might come out as "Dude, chill out! You're screaming like a faniac!" making it slightly obvious that CNA put a censor around it.)

Rigby: I keep having nightmares!

Mordecai: Just dream about something else then. (lies back down) Dream like you're a tough guy or something.

Rigby: (trying to sleep) I'm a tough guy. (He says "tough guy" repeatedly).

(In his dream, he is a tough guy named Fists and is walking down the street at nighttime.)

Fists: They say this city's tough. But I'm tougher. (walks into a dark alley, and a gangster with half of his hair shaved off follows him with a knife)

Gangster: You walked down the wrong alley, Riggerson. (Fists pins him against the wall.)

Fists: The name's... (pulls fist back) ...Fists! (He's about to punch him, but then, the taxi comes and shines its lights on him and the gangster.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

(Fists gasps before the taxi drives into Fists. Rigby wakes up screaming from his second nightmare.)

Mordecai: Augh! (sits up) What the heck, Rigby?!

Rigby: It's that stupid British taxi! It's all up inside my brain!

Mordecai: (groans) I knew it! I knew this would happen! I told you we shouldn't have watched that movie!

Rigby: I know, I'm sorry. I can't help it.

Mordecai: (sighs) Alright, dude, we'll just desensitize you to the horror. We're gonna watch "Ello Gov'nor" over and over again until you stop being scared.

(Rigby gets scared. Cut to the living room, where Mordecai is holding Rigby to the TV as it's paused on a frame of Ello Gov'nor)

Mordecai: Look at it! Look at it!

Rigby: Let me go!

Mordecai: It's not real! You can see the microphone showing! (Sure enough, a boom mic is seen on the frame.) Look at it!

Rigby: Get off me!

Mordecai: I'm sick of you keeping me up! You look at it!

Rigby: Let me go! (fade to the daytime)

Mordecai: Look at it!

Rigby: Let me go!

Mordecai: (fade back to nighttime) Look at it! (fade back to daytime. M&R are tired) Look.... At it.  You look at it.  You...look at it.

Rigby: Let.... Me.... GO! (Rigby breaks free and gets the movie out of the VCR. He throws it against the wall as Benson comes into the room)

Benson: What the heck is going on?!

Mordecai: (pushes Rigby) Rigby's just freaked out by this dumb British movie we watched.

Benson: Well, you'd better have this mess cleaned up by the time I get back from my cricket game.

Mordecai: Cricket?

Benson: Yeah. I'm trying new things. So what?

Mordecai: (gasps) Will British people be there?

Benson: It's cricket, what do you think?

(cuts to cricket match. Sure enough, British people are there)

Mordecai: See Rigby, there's nothing to be afraid of. See how calm and collected these British dudes are? (British people come walking up to MR&B)

British People: Ello, gov'nor. Ello, gov'nor, ello gov'nor, ello, ello, ello... (Rigby gets scared by their greetings. The British people look evil for some reason. Suddenly, the British Taxi appears)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor! (Rigby screams and runs away.)

Mordecai: Rigby! RIGBY! (Rigby's still running towards the house. Pops and Skips walk up to Mordecai.) Aw man, I knew we shouldn't have watched that lame car movie.

Skips: He's scared of cars now?

Mordecai: No, just British taxis.

Pops: What a silly notion, my British taxi isn't scary at all.

Mordecai: Wait, Pops, you own a British taxi?

Pops: Yes.

(clock transition to a barn. Mordecai, Rigby and Pops are entering)

Rigby: What's in the barn?

Mordecai: Something that's gonna get rid of your fear.

(Pops opens barn doors. A yellow taxi stands alone in there)

Pops: There she is. Isn't she a beauty?

Mordecai: What the heck Pops? I thought you said you had a British taxi.

Pops: A British taxi? Oh, I thought you said a brownish taxi.

Mordecai: But that taxi's yellow.

Pops: Yellow? My taxi is no coward, I guarantee you that.

Mordecai: (sighs) Never mind. (He and Pops get ready to enter the taxi) Ready to go for a ride?

Rigby: In that thing? No way.

Mordecai: It's not even a British taxi. Come on.

Rigby: I don't care, a taxi's a taxi!

Mordecai: It'll be fun. We'll just go for a little ride.

Rigby: Uhh, I got to gotta the bathroom.

(cut to the bathroom, Rigby washes hands and pulls the toilet paper to see a tire print. Rigby is shocked as lightning strikes. Rigby looks up to the mirror to see the taxi)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor.

(Rigby gasps and runs out of the bathroom. He goes into a dark office and pants when he stands by the door. The phone rings and Rigby grabs the phone to hear who's on the other end)

British Taxi: (over phone) Ello, gov'nor!

(Rigby gasps again and throws the phone. He turns to the sound of a fax machine printing out the words "ello gov'nor." Rigby screams and runs out, and decides to go with Mordecai and Pops)

Rigby: Let's go, let's go! (gets into the taxi) Drive!

(Pops drives out of barn)

Mordecai: What? What is it?

Rigby: That British taxi, man! It's following me!

Mordecai: Dude, come on. You're just seeing things.

Rigby: No! It was the British taxi and it was real!

Mordecai: So it came out of the movie then?

Rigby: I don't know! Maybe.

Mordecai: Alright, fine, look, you're safe now anyways. Let's just try to relax and calm down, Pops will drive us around for a bit.

Rigby: Hmph.

(fade into sometime later. Pops drives into the woods. Mordecai has fallen asleep, but Pops, although tired, still drives on)

Rigby: Wait, Pops? Where are we going?

Pops: I always drive deep into the woods when I want to clear my mind. Don't you just love the scenery?

(Rigby looks out the window at the trees. They all have evil-looking faces on them. It scares Rigby, and leaves him panting against the seat. He looks out the window again to see the British Taxi. Rigby gasps and looks back to see it driving closer and closer. He whimpers as the car suddenly stops)

Pops: Oh, bother.

Rigby: What? Why are we stopping? What's going on?

Pops: It seems we've run out of gasoline.

Rigby: Oh man, oh man, this is not good! He's coming and we're stuck here! Mordecai!

Mordecai: (Wakes up, screaming) What, what is it?

Rigby: We ran out of gas, and he's coming for me! (ducks to bottom of taxi)

Mordecai: (to Pops) Come on, we gotta get out and push. (to Rigby) Come on, Rigby.

Rigby: No! I'm not going out there!

Mordecai: Fine, Pops and I will push you all the way home then. (Him and Pops exit the taxi and start pushing it back) Geez.

Rigby: No, no, no, no, no, not back this way! (sees headlights of British taxi and gasps. They're coming closer) No, no, no, no, no! (M&P see the British taxi coming, but aren't scared)

Mordecai: Alright, help. (Rigby gets out of the taxi screaming, and runs off) Rigby! (looks back and sees that the car really is the British taxi)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

Mordecai: Holy crap, it's real! (In the UK, this line is changed to "Oh man, dudes, it's real!") Run, Pops!

(M&P run away. The British taxi runs over Pops' taxi, shattering it to pieces. Rigby's still running. M&P follow. The taxi is still chasing the three. They all jump over a log, but the British taxi keeps going and runs over the log)

Mordecai: Pops, look out! (grabs Pops in the nick of time. The taxi's still driving on. M&P watch it go) Oh no! It's going after Rigby! We gotta help him! (Pops puts his hat back on)

Mordecai and Pops: Rigby! (Rigby is still running. His tail touches the grill, almost running him over. Rigby sprints, and ends up in a dead end. The taxi comes up and corners Rigby, leading him to lean against a tree. The taxi isn't giving up)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor. (Rigby screams)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(M&P get hit by the taxi's doors, knocking them unconcious.)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor!

Rigby: I'm no gov'nor!

(Rigby tries to run away, but bumps into a tree. The British taxi laughs evilly. Rigby opens his eyes and sees the taxi try to run him over)

British Taxi: Ello, gov'nor! (Rigby gets up to face the taxi)

Rigby:(furious) The name's FISTS! (smashes taxi's headlights) Leave me alone! (punches bumper and kicks grill) I hate you! (pulls doors off, bites off taxi sign, and rips off roof. Then, he walks off and smashes a tree atop the ravaged car) Stop following me around!

(cut to Mordecai and Pops holding Rigby down. Rigby's squirming)

Mordecai: Rigby! Wake up! Rigby, stop it!

Rigby: Stop... Mordecai?

Pops: Oh, thank show you're alright.

Rigby: I did it! I conquered my fear! I cleaned that taxi's clock, with my fists.

Mordecai: Kind of, you hit your head and started going psycho on the taxi, but, actually, the taxi was a kid.

(the taxi unfolds itself to reveal that it was the employee from the video store)

Rigby: You?

Employee: Yeah, what's your problem?

Rigby: Why were you following me in that taxi suit?

Employee: (sighs. He's holding a paper) My boss made me wear this. I'm from the video store. Your rental is overdue.

Mordecai: Why didn't you just call or something?

Employee: I did, and I sent a fax!

Rigby: That was you?

Employee: Yes! So can you just return the video, please?

Rigby: We broke it.

Employee: Well, you're gonna have to pay for it.

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops?

Pops: Of course. I'm afraid the smallest bill I have is a 100. Will that do?

Employee: Yeah. Sure. (Pops hands him a lollipop, not a $100.00 bill) Is this some kind of joke? (sees Mordecai and Rigby taking Pops away) I gotta get a better job.

(Cut to the house. M&R are in bed)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Augh, not again.

Rigby: Don't worry, dude, I'm not scared again. I just—Thanks, dude, for helping me out with my fears and stuff.

Mordecai: No problem, man. Good night, Rigby.

Rigby: Good night, Mordecai.

(ripple transition to Rigby's dream. He's in his Fists persona, driving a car)

Fists: They say this city's pretty tough. But I'm tougher.

Margaret: I got into my dream school. (Mordecai is shocked by this.) I really like you Mordecai, and what we have is special, but I may never get this opportunity again. (She starts crying.) I'm sorry, but... I can't be your girlfriend. (The scene shows Margaret running through the restaurant crying, and Mordecai is left heartbroken. Then it rewinds back to the last sentences Margaret said.) I can't be your girlfriend. (echos) Girlfriend...girlfriend...girlfriend.

(The next scene shows Mordecai all depressed in his bed and he groans. Then it shows Rigby, Benson, Pops and Skips watching him. Benson wanted to say something to him, but Rigby stops him so he can just let Mordecai be alone then the next day, it shows Mordecai looking out the Coffee Shop's window and shows that it is very busy and Eileen is serving everyone their orders, then Eileen serves a coffee to a girl that looks like Margaret from the back, and Mordecai is surprised thinking that she came back, but when she turns around it was not Margaret, then Mordecai gets depressed again and walks away, then it shows Rigby playing video games and Mordecai drops his controler, Rigby notices and picks up Mordecai's controler then he continues playing, but Mordecai drops it again and cries, then it shows Mordecai reading, but he sees other couples including Muscle Man and Starla and Mordecai throws his book on the ground and walks away, then it shows Mordecai in his room and he looks at the sky and sees a constellation that looks just like Margaret, then the rest of the gang comes in and try to cheer Mordecai up because they can't stand to see Mordecai all sad in his room in the dark, the next scene shows the gang at the bowling alley and Rigby gives Mordecai a soda and Skips places his hand on Mordecai's shoulder showing he cares, smiling and Mordecai smiles back, then it shows Muscle Man cheering Mordecai up by making fun of Thomas and they all laugh at it, then it shows Mordecai lifting weights at Skips place along with Pops helping him out, then it shows Mordecai in the bathroom washing his face and shaving with Muscle Man watching while he eats a piece of pie, then it shows Mordecai taking out the trash and working up a sweat and Benson gives him a thumbs up, then it shows Mordecai and Rigby playing video games again, and Mordecai beats him and cheering and Rigby smiles, then Mordecai punches him and continues being happy as he can be.)

(The next scene shows Mordecai and Rigby doing laundry)

Rigby: Man, laundry takes forever.

Mordecai: You know, this would be faster if you helped out.

Rigby: Nah, man, you got this. (He takes a sip of his soda) Besides, all you got left is one sweater. (Mordecai picks up the sweater) One...pink...sweater. (Mordecai looks at it, and gets shocked) Oh, no. (Rigby drops his soda and Mordecai backs up) Don't do anything you're gonna regret. DON'T DO IT! (Mordecai sniffs the sweater and all the memories of Mordecai and Margaret together are shown.) Dude, no! What do you think you're doing?!

Mordecai: Margaret's sweater. She left it here for me to find. I have to give it back to her.

Rigby: No, you don't! She probably has tons of these things, chicks love holding clothes, it's a fact. Besides, it's not even that cold out.

Mordecai: Yeah, but what if it's her favorite sweater?

Rigby: Come on, if she really liked it, she wouldn't have left it.

Mordecai: No, dude, I gotta give it back to her.

Rigby: I don't know. I don't think that's such a good idea.

Mordecai: I'll just mail it.

Rigby: Uh... I guess mailing its okay.

(Rigby hands the sweater back to Mordecai)

Mordecai: Yeah, it's gonna be fine. (The next scene shows Rigby playing video games and Mordecai is writing a letter) Dear Margaret, Hmm-hmm-hmm. Ugh! No. Ugh! (Mordecai rips off the sheet of paper, crumbles it and throws right at Rigby) Hm, oh! I found your sweater, and it still smells like you, even though I washed it. Ugh! Weird, weird. This isn't working. It would be easier if I just give it to her by myself.

Rigby: Dude, you want to go see her? You just got over her. If you see her now, you'll just be (in a dull voice) depressed Mordecai again. (in normal voice) That guy's lame. That guy's the worst.

Mordecai: Hey, I'm just giving her back the sweater.

Rigby: It's a bad idea, dude.

Mordecai: I'm fine.

Rigby: Fine! You can't even write her a stupid letter, how is seeing her going to be better?

Mordecai: Whatever man, I'm just not good at writing letters. Don't worry about it. (Mordecai leaves, then Rigby puts the sweater in a box and writes on it, but then Mordecai comes back) What are you doing? (Rigby runs off with the box) Dude! (Mordecai chases after him and Rigby puts the box in the mailbox) Wait!

Rigby: Hmm-hmm!

Mordecai: I can't believe you did that. I would've mailed it.

Rigby: Sure you would've.

(Knock on the door and the postman at the door.)

Postman: If I can't read it, I can't send it.

(The box is shown to have scribbles on it)

Rigby: Come on, that's perfectly clear. (The postman gives the box) Aw, man. Hey, where you goin'?

Mordecai: I'm just going to re-address this to the post office.

Rigby: Wait, so you're just going to take this to the post office? Yourself?

Mordecai: Mm-hm.

Rigby: For real?

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. (Rigby looks at him suspiciously) Yeah, mm-hm, yeah. (They walk up to Muscle Man) Hey Muscle Man, can I borrow your car? I got something I gotta take care of.

Muscle Man: Geez, at this rate, you might as well buy it if you keep borrowing it so much. (He takes a bite out of his chicken leg)

Mordecai: It'll be real quick. Come on.

Muscle Man: Fine. But make sure you take your laundry out of it this time, bro. Unlike some people, I like keeping my things nice. (He wipes off grease on his chest and throws Mordecai his car keys)

Mordecai: Thanks. (He gets inside the car, along with Rigby) What are you doing?

Rigby: What? I just thought you might want some company to the post office. It can get pretty boring, you know, at the post office.

Mordecai: Uh yeah, yep.

(They drive around and Rigby keeps suspiciously looking at Mordecai, but Mordecai passses the post office)

Rigby: Dude, you just passed it!

Mordecai: I'm looking for parking.

(Short pause)

Rigby: We're going to her college, are we?

Mordecai: Yes.

Rigby: You're gonna drive twenty hours to return a sweater?! She probably doesn't know it's missing.

Mordecai: Look, it's her sweater. She should have it back.

Rigby: The sweater doesn't even matter, you're just making excuses.

Mordecai: What? No.

Rigby: Oh yeah. Then I guess it doesn't matter if I do this.

(Rigby opens a window and throws the sweater out the window and Mordecai gets surprised by this and tries to turn back but a car is in his way)

Mordecai: Why did you do that?! What's your problem, man?

Rigby: I'm not the one with the problem. That sweater is messing with your head.

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

Rigby: Just forget it. That sweater's gone, and it's never coming back.

(Then a cop comes by and pulls over Mordecai and Rigby)

Cop: You boys should really be more careful. I've seen too many good clothes lost in this highway, and this is one quality sweater. It's at least 50 percent cashmere. Plus, it smells really good. I'm glad I got a hold of it before it was too late. Here you go, sir. Take good care of this beauty. (He drives away)

Rigby: Ugh!

Mordecai: Dude, I have to give this sweater to her now. This is a sign.

Rigby: This is dumb! You can't drive twenty hours straight by yourself.

Mordecai: Well I'm going too. Because it's fate. (He puts the sweater in the back seat)

Rigby: Ugh! (It shows a montage of them driving on the road with Rigby starting to fall asleep and Mordecai drinking lots of coffee. Then at night, Rigby is seen sleeping and Mordecai looking messed up and tired. Then the next morning, Mordecai starts to fall asleep and starts to be far off the road. Rigby wakes up and notices) Whoa! Dude, dude, the road! (Mordecai wakes up and gets back on the road) Dude, what the heck? Have you been driving all night? You look awful.

Mordecai: It's fine, it's fine. I just gotta give Margaret back the sweater. Almost there.

Rigby: (furious) Fine? Fine?! Not fine. (rapping) Not fine, not fine. You've been driving all this time, your eyes, they must be blind.

Mordecai: (annoyed) Cut it out.

Rigby: (still rapping) Not fine, not fine. How can you say you're fine? Thinking bout the sweater, gotta pull yourself together. This plan would only hurt, you can never make it work!

Mordecai: (irritated) Rigby! Quit it!

Rigby: (still rapping) Not fine, not fine. You're anything but fine. Ditch that stupid sweater, you should be moving on! The past is in the past, you and Margaret said so long!

Mordecai: (finally loses it and elbows Rigby) I said cut it out! Why are so against me giving Margaret her sweater back?

Rigby: 'Cause it's not about the sweater, and you know it. You gotta forget about Margaret.

Mordecai: Dude, Margaret's important to me. I can't just forget her.

Rigby: Okay, okay. You don't have to forget her, but you have to get over her for real. Staying like this is messed up, and is messing you up. I want my friend back.

Mordecai: Well, if you were a real friend, you would understand.

Rigby: I am your friend. (sternly) You'd realize it if you weren't such a sad sack chump!

Mordecai: (enraged) That's it!

(Enraged that Rigby called him "sad sack chump", Mordecai stops the car and pushes Rigby out of the car and drives away)

Rigby: (dismayed) Ah, man!

(Rigby sighs and starts running after him)

Mordecai: Stupid Rigby. Why can't he just back me up? I'm just trying to get her sweater back. Right?

(Suddenly, Margaret's sweater comes to life and reveals a red aura that looks just like Margaret)

Margaret's Sweater: Of course. Of course you are, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Huh?

Margaret's Sweater: You're just trying to do the right thing. I understand completely.

Mordecai: Ah. I knew you would. But why can't Rigby? I know he means well. Maybe I shouldn't have kicked them out. I should go back and get him. If you talked to him, he'll understand.

Margaret's Sweater: Now, now. There's no need for that. The sweater's the only thing that matters. Forget Rigby.

Mordecai: Forget Rigby?

Margaret's Sweater: He'll never understand. He'll only get in the way.

Mordecai: But...

Margaret's Sweater: The sooner you give Margaret the sweater, the sooner she'll quit school and be with you. The two of you will be happy forever.

Mordecai: That's not true. Margaret worked really hard to get to school. She wouldn't just quit.

Margaret's Sweater: FOOL! (She wraps around her arm to Mordecai's arm)

Mordecai: What are you doing?!

Margaret's Sweater: What needs to be done. She has to have her sweater back, Mordecai.

(Mordecai struggles to turn around but the sweater prevents)

Mordecai: Ahh! Get off of me! (The sweater hisses at him and wraps her arm around Mordecai's leg and starts to speed up) You can't make me do this. (He pulls the stick but the sweater pushes him back)

Margaret's Sweater: Return the sweater! You can't fight it! Just think how happy she'll be. How happy you'll be.

Mordecai: No! Rigby was right, I shouldn't be doing this. I need to get over Margaret!

College Guy 1: Yeah! Vegans need to eat, too.

(They head straight to Milton University and they almost run into everybody)

College Guy 2: Uh, so I guess Williams Hall would be over here?

(Mordecai almost runs into the guy and crashes into the statue then he notices all the laundry in the front)

Mordecai: What the...?

College Guy 3: WHOOOO! Hope you came to college so you can learn how to drive.

Margaret: (off-screen) Yeah, are you guys excited for that guest speaker tomorrow?

Mordecai: Margaret?

College Guy 4: Oh, definitely.

College Girl: For sure.

Margaret: Yeah, it's just so cool that we get to access that kind of experience here, you know?

College Guy 4: Yeah, you won't find that everywhere.

(Mordecai tries to walk up to her, but he stops for a moment.)

Margaret: I wrote down some questions to ask after the lecture.

College Guy 4: Yeah, we'll see, if you don't chicken out this time.

Margaret: Oh, come on. One time that happened. (Mordecai stands there watching Margaret and he throws the sweater in the trash can. Margaret notices something and moves her gaze to the trash can, but Mordecai was no longer there.) So you guys want to head over to the quad?

(Rigby comes back and is completely exhausted and out of breath.)

Rigby: D...don't....Morde...cai....don't... swea....sweater....stop.

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. I didn't give it to her.

Rigby: Ah.

Mordecai: You were right to try and stop me.

Rigby: Yeah, I know.

Mordecai: Sorry for kicking you out of the car.

Rigby: It's okay. Sorry for calling you a sad sack chump.

Mordecai: No, Depressed Mordecai is a chump. Let's go home. Do you think Muscle Man will notice we messed up his car?

Rigby: Nah, it pretty much looks the same.

Young Mordecai and Rigby: Wow!

(Then it shows "Zombies Return 2: Massacre Mall" on the TV, and it shows Mordecai and Rigby as teens playing it)

Teen Mordecai and Rigby: Wow!

(Then it shows "Zombies Return 3: Blood Bunker" on the TV, and it shows slightly older Mordecai and Rigby playing it)

Older Mordecai and Rigby: Wow!

(Back at the present, it shows Mordecai and Rigby watching TV and Mordecai keeps changing the channels)

Rigby: Lame. Boring. Change it. Change it.

TV Announcer: From the series that just wouldn't die. (Mordecai and Rigby are surprised by this) Control a zombie with all new moves. Boomer-arm, Bellowing Bile. The final game with more terror, and bigger bites. "Zombies Return 4: Fatal Finale". (rapidly) $49.99. Wherever video games are sold.

Mordecai: Dude, it's the last game of the series!

Rigby: Aw, man! Did you see those graphics? It looks just like real life! (makes video games sounds)

Mordecai: We need to get that game.

Rigby: How? All those bits cost extra money.

Mordecai: Hmm. (The next scene shows Benson's office, and Mordecai and Rigby slightly open the door and start to whisper) Benson.

(Benson didn't hear it)

Rigby: Benson. (Benson starts to get angry) Benson, can you hear us?

Benson: Yes, I can hear you! What do you want?!

Rigby: What'cha doing?

Benson: What game do you want to buy?

Mordecai: Game? (laughs) What? No, come on. We wanna work, you know? Get our hands dirty. Sunshine. (Benson stops and looks at him) Zombies Return 4.

Benson: No. If you buy some new game, you'll end up doing even less work than you do now.

Rigby: It's not just some new video game, it's the last in the quadrilogy.

Mordecai: This game grew up with us and we grew up with it. We need to see it through to the end.

Benson: (thinking) Hmm. I guess there is one thing left. If you wax all the floors. (Mordecai and Rigby are excited) And I mean ALL of them.

Mordecai & Rigby: Whooooooaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Barame dame dames, playing video games!

Benson: NOW!!

Mordecai and Rigby: Barame dame dame.

(Mordecai and Rigby run out and start waxing the kitchen floors rushingly)

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

(Benson later comes in.)

Benson: What are you doing?

Rigby: What?

(Benson picks up the chair.)

Benson: This is NOT how you do this! (puts it back on the floor and it slides to Mordecai and Rigby) You have to pick up every piece of furniture and move it outside... including the fridge!

Rigby: How are we supposed to do that?

Benson: Figure it out!! And clean the floors before you wax them!

Mordecai: But--.

Benson: Do it right or I won't pay you! (walks out) Why do I even--?

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugh!

Mordecai: Come on, let's get this over with.

(Mordecai and Rigby move the fridge out of the way, revealing a large fridge stain. They are sickened by the sight of it.)

Rigby: This is gonna take forever!

Mordecai: Wait. Shh. Do you hear that?

Rigby: Hear what?

Mordecai: Money.

(They look out the window. They notice a silver guy performing acts and earning money from people passing by.)

Rigby: Whoa. That silver guy is just juggling glass balls and people are paying to see it.

Mordecai: Dude, that's it! A few hours of street performing, and we'll have the cash to get that game.

Rigby: Sure beats waxing the floors like a chump. (throws the sponge in the bucket and kicks the bucket) Now let's get some silver paint.

Mordecai: No, dude. We can't rip that guy off, it's not cool. We gotta come up with our own thing.

Rigby: Like what?

Mordecai: Something we're good at. (rapping) Should be entertaining.

Rigby: (rapping) Probably not too straining.

Mordecai: (rapping) Something super easy.

Rigby: (rapping) But nothing that's too cheesy.

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) How 'bout singing songs, to make a little cash. If we sing 'em up right, we can make a fat stash!

Mordecai: Money stash!

Rigby: Money stash!

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) Sing some songs, and make 'em really funny. Get people to stop, and drop all of their money, into our hats.

Mordecai: Dude, that's it! Let's just make up some songs.

Rigby: Yeah, they're so easy. How do we do that anyway?

Mordecai: Probably 'cause we're such good friends.

Rigby: You really think people will pay us for that?

Mordecai: They paid that dude that juggled glass balls, did they?

Rigby: Good point.

(The next scene shows Mordecai and Rigby setting up their street performance)

Rigby: (Hamboning intro) (rapping) We wanna buy a video game.

Mordecai: (rapping) Video zombies eating video brains.

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) Zombies struttin', chomping dude like muffins! Zombies struttin', chomping dude like muffins! Those graphics look insane, gotta gotta get this game!

Mordecai: (rapping) So we went and ask for more chores.

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) But our boss, Benson got us waxing the floors! Waxing, waxing. Agh! Waxing, waxing. Agh!

(Everyone seeing the silver guy start coming over to Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai: (beatboxing)

Rigby: (rapping) Shoulders aching, back is breaking.

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) Don't wanna be waxing, when we could be relaxing!

Rigby: Playing video games.

(Everyone starts applauding and they some money in their hat)

Mordecai: Dude, it's totally working!

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. We should've thought of this years ago.

Mordecai: Let's keep going. (he clears his throat, and then he starts rapping) Sun, sun shining.

Rigby: (rapping) Day is so inviting.

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) But dollar dollar bills equals zombie fun timing.

Mordecai: (rapping) People walkin' by-o stop and say hi-o.

Rigby: (rapping) Put some dinero in the sombrero.

Mordecai: (rapping) Hey there, buddy, put some money in the hat.

Rigby: (rapping) Speed walking guy, put some money in the hat.

Mordecai: (rapping) Lady with the baby, put some money in the hat.

Rigby: (rapping) Dude with the eyebrows, put some money in the hat.

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) Money in the hat-hat, money's where it's at-at. Money!

(Scene transitions to Cheezer's)

(Mordecai is counting the money, while Rigby is eating a sandwich)

Mordecai: (to Rigby) Dude, just a few more songs and we can get that game.

Rigby: Why stop there? We should do this every day.

Mordecai: If we make this our job we'll hate it. Gotta keep it special!

Rigby: We can still do this for the rest of the day, right?

Mordecai: Yeah-uh we can!

Mordecai and Rigby: (while leaving) Zombies Return. Zombies Return. Zombie's Return.

(Cut back to The Park. M&R are walking with their street performance setup. Suddenly, they heard one of their raps. It is shown that the Silver Dude recorded and remixed their rap on his boombox and uses it for his street performing.)

Mordecai: (on boombox) Sun, sunshining.

Mordecai: (as he hears one of their raps being played) What the?!

Rigby: (on boombox) Day is so inviting.

Mordecai and Rigby: (on boombox) But dollar dollar bills equals zombie fun timing.

(The Silver Dude concludes his performance and the people who were watching applaud. A boy puts some money in the box.)

Mordecai: Dude, that's our song! Stop copying us!

Silver Dude: I'm not copying. (rolls his glass balls) I'm re-interpreting.

Rigby: You're just recording our voices!

Silver Dude: Being silver makes it different.

Rigby: It's the same thing with a different color!

Silver Dude: Street law! If you can't take the heat, stay off the pavement!

Rigby: I'll whup your pavement!

Mordecai: Dude, relax. (to Silver Dude) We wrote the songs. People'll come to us no matter where we are in the park.

Rigby: (as he and Mordecai leave with their stuff) Yeah, stay away from us, you silver-coated dirt bag!

(cut to M&R at the front of park)

Mordecai: It's alright. We'll bring people here with our freestyling.

Silver Dude: Plus, I'm silver.

Rigby: We know you're silver! STOP COPYING US! (tackles Silver Dude to the ground and they start brawling. A drawing of a man begin to come to life.)

Mordecai: (trying to break it up) Rigby, don't!

Man: Now what is all this ruckus?

(A funny dressed man reveals himself)

Mordecai: Who are you?

God of Street Performing: Why, I'm the God if Street Performing. (acts as a one-man band) What seems to be the problem?

Rigby: (points to Silver Dude) This guy stole our act!

God of Street Performing: My children, why it causes me such great heartache to hear somethin' like this.

Mordecai: We just wanna make enough money to buy a video game, then we'll go home.

God of Street Performing: There's only one way to solve a dispute of this nature. We shall have a competition! Whoever performs the greatest shall keep the act, and obtain all the winnings from the sombrero. Y'all agree to this challenge? Mordecai and Rigby?

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!

Rigby: Make your own music and don't steal ours!

Mordecai: Our original songs have unique powers!

(Mordecai and Rigby have a yellow glow around them)

Our songs come from within

Mess with us and you'll never win!

Cause you're nothin' without your lame boom box!

(audience sways hands to song)

You're nothin' without your lame boom box!

(the boombox begins to grow)

Boom box boom, boom box boom, boom box boom, boom box boom!

Ya wanna remix? Well remix this!♪

(Mordecai and Rigby shoot at the boombox with yellow lasers, which it got destroyed and the explosion wiped off Silver Dude's silver paint off him, then the crowd cheers and the money goes back into Mordecai and Rigby's sombrero.)

Silver Dude: Uhhhhh.... (rapping)

♪Once upon a time there was a cow that was purple

Walking through the grass and have found a chicken that was...Uhhhhh...zhurple?♪

(The crowd boos at him as he rolls his glass balls and throws them away)

Silver Dude: Well, I'm a Silver Dude and I'm here to say...Give me the money! (He tried to take the money from Mordecai and Rigby's sombrero, but he hit an edge of an invisible glass placed by the God of Street Performing) Oh no! No, please! Don't send me to street jail! (the God of Street Performing turns Silver Dude into a mime) No! (the God of Street Performing starts to lift the invisible box which has Silver Dude in it with gravity, then he hits Silver Dude up in the sky and he explodes)

(The crowd cheers)

Mordecai and Rigby: Wooaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!!!!!!!

God of Street Performing: Now, that was some mighty fine street performing, boys. Now let's go get your vidi-game.

(The scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby playing Zombies Return 4 where the zombie uses the bellowing bile at the man which he melts)

Mordecai, Rigby and God of Street Performing: Whoooooo!!!!

(the God of Street Performing starts doing splits while Mordecai and Rigby cheered)

Benson: Are you guys gonna finish waxing the floors or wha...

(Benson sees the God of Street Performing doing some splits on the carpet)

Benson: I'm also gonna need you to vacuum the carpet, mostly this spot right here.

Mordecai: Aw, yea-yuh! Time for some Zombie Pep Squad.

Rigby: I heard this movie has the world record for most stings in a movie ever!

Mordecai: You heard right. (Turns on the movie)

Movie Boy: What do you say we ditch the party and head on up to Make Out Point?

Movie Girl: OK, but... (Opens a locker to find a zombie girl leaning out, growling. A sting plays.)

Mordecai: Here we go.

Movie Boy: Relax, babe. (He suddenly grows fangs and hisses, making the girl scream. A group of zombie girls gang up behind and surround her as multiple stings play.)

Rigby: Hey, dude, can you pause it for a sec? I'm gonna go get some chips.

Mordecai: No way! It'll ruin the flow.

Rigby: Dude, just pause it for a sec!

Mordecai: No!

Rigby: But I'm starving! (Tries to take the remote)

Mordecai: You just ate six bags of chips.

Rigby: And now I need more.

Mordecai: In a minute!

Rigby: No, now!

(As they struggle for the remote, Mordecai slips on a chip bag. The remote flies out of his hand and through an open window. A crash is heard. Him and Rigby rush to the window and stare in shock. Zooms in a shot of Benson's car with the remote logded into the windshield. A sting plays. They run outside to the car.)

Mordecai: Benson's windshield! This is not good. What are we gonna do?

Rigby: Maybe he won't even know it was us. It could've been anybody. Pops, Skips, Thomas. Yeah, let's pin it on Thomas!

Mordecai: No, dude. If we don't get this fixed before Benson finds out, he's gonna fire us.

Rigby: Aw, man! And I still don't have chips. (Zoom into Rigby's angry face as a sting plays.)

Mordecai: Yeah, we should've paused the movie. (Cut to him and Rigby searching through Benson's office.) Keep looking. Benson's car keys have to be here somewhere.

Rigby: (Snaps) His jacket.

Mordecai: Dude, of course!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm!

(They are about to reach into Benson's jacket hanging on the door when he suddendly enters the room, carrying a box.)

Benson: What the? (Mordecai and Rigby gasp) What are you doing in my office?

Mordecai: (Worriedly) Uh, nothing.

Rigby: We were doing nothing.

Benson: Did you do that thing I asked you to do?

Mordecai: Thing? Uh, we were gonna do that thing.

Rigby: (Nods) Totally gonna do the thing.

Mordecai: Could you just give us instructions, though? Just having a hard time getting started.

Benson: You need instructions for raking?

Mordecai and Rigby: Yes!

Benson: (Walks to the window and gestures to the rake outside) You see that raky thing out there? Pick it up and rake with it!

(Mordecai and Rigby glance at the jacket.)

Rigby: Uh, actually, could you show us? We're more visual learners.

Benson: (Sighs and begins to demonstrate) You walk over to some leaves, take your hands, grab the rake...

(Mordecai and Rigby go 'Hmm!' as they inch closer to the door.)

Benson: ...and then you raaake the leaves. You raaake the leaves. (They start to reach into the jacket) Hey! What are you doing back there?

Mordecai: Oh! Um, we can see better from here.

Rigby: Yeah, so we can get the whole... (Trails off)

Benson: (Turns red) Leave! (Runs and pushes them out the door)

Mordecai: Uh, thanks, Benson!

Rigby: Dude! Yeah, man! Really helpful.

(Both are shut out and Benson sighs. They are now outside in the window's view as Benson watches them.)

Mordecai: Hey, Benson! Like this, right? (Starts to rake)

Benson: Yeah, real good. Are we done? Got a lot of work to do here.

(Rigby sneaks open the door and takes Benson's keys out of his jacket. Clock transition to the autobody shop with the car.)

Roger: (Inspeting the car) Mm-hm, mm-hm. Uh-huh, uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uhhh-huh! Yep, yep. Broken windshield.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan.)

Mordecai: We know.

Rigby: How much?

Roger: Eh, I'll do it for...300 bucks.

Rigby: We can't afford that. How 'bout 65?

Roger: You dare come into my store with an offer like that? I'm an artiste! Get outta here! (Walks away)

Mordecai: Dude, nice going. (Clock transition to the Park. Mordecai drives the car behind a bush. Him and Rigby walk outside of it.) Dude, we'll just hide the car here while we figure out a Plan B.

(A police siren is heard and we pan to the house. Muscle Man is using a metal detector with Hi-Five Ghost, and Benson is speaking to two police officers.)

Benson: Yeah, the old kind of station wagon.

Mordecai: (Walking up) Oh! Uh, hey, Benson. What's going on?

Benson: My car is missing.

Rigby: Or maybe you never had one in the first place? (Mordecai punches him) Ow!

Benson: Not likely, Rigby. That car is the most important thing I own. So, officers, when you find it-

Officer: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! We'll keep an eye out for it but... (Whistles) Hm.

Benson: What is that? Does that mean you'll find my car?

Officer: Let's just say you're gonna wanna get a bus pass. (Both officers laugh as they walk to their car and drive away.)

Benson: Lousy cops. I'm going inside.

Mordecai: Are you all right, Benson?

Benson: (Walking up the steps to the house) I'm fine.

Rigby: Dude, this is awesome!

Mordecai: What is?

Rigby: Benson says he's fine, so if we just ditch the car, we're off the hook!

Mordecai: No, Rigby. Look at him. (Benson is in a room, breaking furniture in anger.) We need to fix this.

Muscle Man: (Eating chips) I knew it was you losers! Where'd you stash the car?

Mordecai: Please don't say anything, Muscle Man!

Rigby: Yeah, Benson can't find out.

Muscle Man: Show me the damage or I talk. (Clock transition the bush where the car is hidden. He's using the metal detector to inspect the car.) Woo-hoo! Yeah, I really hit the motherload over here!

Mordecai: Come on, dude! Just help us find someone who can fix it for cheap.

Muscle Man: Ugh. Here, hold my gear, and don't even look at my chips. (Rigby glares while holding the detector. Muscle Man hops on the car and looks at crack.) Hmm. Yeah, this is polyvinyl butyral laminated breeze resistant glass. But don't worry. I know a guy who'll fix it for real cheap.

(Clock transition to Benson in his office. The lights are turned off and he's looking through the blinds of a window. A man enters the room.)

Benson: Thanks for coming on such short notice. Please have a seat. (Drinks from his mug as the man sits down) Oh, and could you get the light? (Lights are turned on and Benson sits down) Thanks, Bring 'Em Back Jack.

Jack: No problemo.

Benson: I've never hired a bounty hunter before. Just curious, though. Are you really from the future like your ad says?

Jack: Huh, huh! (Shows a bronze casing around his arm with multiple weapons inside. The letters V.I.C.K.I are written in red on it.) I got a voice activated future gun here. Hello.

VICKI: Hello, Jack.

Jack: VICKI, silent mode. See? VICKI stands for Voice Input Calling and Killing Instrument.

Benson: Whatever. Can you track down the scum that stole my car or not?

Jack: Heck, yeah, brah! I just need half my payment up front, half when you get your car back, and I only ask one more thing. (Zooms on his face with a dark expression) That I can do whatever I want to the perps when I find them. (Normal again) See in the future, violence is outlawed.

Benson: Fine. Just get my car back.

Jack: That'll be 500,000 dollars.

Benson: Now, I do have an Internet coupon. (Hands the coupon to Jack. It reads, "New costomer offer! Your first bounty $500".)

Jack: In the future, Internet coupons are also outlawed, but since we're in your time, I guess I'll honor it.

Benson: Great. Here's half. 250 dollars.

Jack: You're lucky I like fantasy violence in adult situations so much. (Walks out the room to outside the house. He jumps off the porch and onto the ground) VICKI, analyze clue.

VICKI: (Sends three red lasers to inspect the ground while Jack moves around) Broken glass. Dirt. Dirt. Tire tracks.

Jack: Bingo.

(Now nighttime, clock transition to Mordecai and Rigby with the car. They're somewhere in the city, near a parking lot.)

Rigby: Are you sure this is the place? This place is way off the sticks, man.

Mordecai: This is where Muscle Man's instructions say to wait. Oh, and we gotta signal. (Flashes the car's headlights three times)

Rigby: Dude, nothing happened.

(A truck's headlights turn on as a man drives up next to them. The truck is holding a bunch of windshields in the back. The man sniffs)

Mordecai: You Armond?

Armond: You have 60 bucks?

(Mordecai hands the money to him. Armond takes it and hops out of the truck's window to inspect Benson's windshield)

Rigby: Dude, can you fix it?

Armond: (Sniffs the car and the remote deeply) Gimme 1 hour.

(Mordecai and Rigby smiles. Clock transition back to the autobody shop. Jack is recording a drawing of what Roger is describing of Mordecai and Rigby.)

Roger: They weren't real with it. Oh, a little on the pointy side.

Jack: Hm, these the guys? (Shows his drawing, albeit poorly made)

Roger: Eh...

Jack: Don't worry. VICKI's got it covered. (He brings out VICKI and it scans the drawing. It then shows a hologram of Mordecai and Rigby)

VICKI: Targets identified. Morde-c-ai and Ri-by.

Roger: Not bad.

Jack: Now, locate targets.

VICKI: (Using a hologram compass) Target location. The Park.

Jack: Call the coffin shop, VICKI.

Female Operator: (Bored) Hello, Sunset Coffin Shop.

Jack: Yeah, I'm gonna need two coffins for later today.

Female Operator: Wonderful, and will you need any flowers arrangements with that?

Jack: Not necessary. (Laughs darkly)

(Fade to Mordecai pushing the car back to the Park while Rigby sits in the driver's seat, singing)

Rigby: ♪Oh, driving in a car. Yeah, we busted Benson's windshield. Gotta fix it fast or Benson'll fire us for...breaking his windshield. We're gonna looose ourrr job!♪

Mordecai: Dude, cut it out or Benson's gonna catch us. (Pushes the car in front of the house. Rigby walks out, holding paper) Oh, man, that was close.

Rigby: Yeah, let's just put the note on and get outta here. (Places the note under a windshield wiper. It reads, "Sorry I borrowed your car without asking. - a Common Crimminal".) Done and done.

VICKI: (Off-screen) Your targets are in range.

Jack: (Suddenly tumbles out of a nearby bush) You didn't really think you'd get away with this, did ya?

Mordecai: Who are you?

Jack: Benson hired me to find the guys who stole his car. So now that I found you it's time to kill you! (Takes out VICKI and opens the weapons)

Mordecai: (Him and Rigby back away) Dude! We-we were just-

Jack: VICKI, destroy targets! (Fires a red bomb at the two, who safely dodge it. The bomb blows a hole in the house garage, however.) Come on, VICKI! Destroy targets! (Hits VICKI)

Mordecai: (He gasps, then he and Rigby run up the steps to the house, yelling. He closes the door behind him) Benson called a bounty hunter? He must be really mad!

Rigby: (Pushes a closet in front of the door) What do we do?

Mordecai: We gotta get Benson to call him off!

(An incoming missile is heard as the two run away. The missile blows up the door and closet. Jack walks in, watching them run down the hall. He fires three missiles inside the house, destroying some of it.)

Jack: VICKI, play epic tunes. (VICKI does so. Jack approaches Mordecai and Rigby in the kitchen.) Scramble missiles! (He fires missiles around as the two run away. He then walks to Pops and Skips, sitting at the table. Both are eating sandwiches and watching in surprise.) Sorry, innocent bystanders. (He walks out the kitchen and inspects the living room. Thomas walks in the room but walks straight back out at the sight of Jack. Jack then tumbles to a closet door.) VICKI, vaporize door! (VICKI vaporizes the door and unveils Mordecai and Rigby.) Time to shut you down for good.

VICKI: (Closes all weapons) Shutting down.

Jack: No!

Mordecai: Run! (Him and Rigby run to Benson's office as Jack hits VICKI.)

Jack: Uh, p-power on!

Mordecai and Rigby: (Dashing into the office) Benson!

Benson: (Comes from under his desk) Guys? Listen, you gotta lay low. I think Jack found the guys that stole my car.

Mordecai: He did find them, 'cause we took your car.

Benson: (Angrily) What?!

Rigby: (Hurriedly) We were fighting over the remote, and the remote cracked your windshield, so we took it to a guy to fix it, then we took it to another guy, but it's all better now! Could you call the future guy off?

Benson: (Growls loudly, red with anger) I'll deal with you two later. We have to stop Jack.

(Another missile explodes, crumbling some of the ceiling. Cuts to Jack outside, blasting holes in the house)

Jack: (Laughs) Come out, come out, wherever you are!

Benson: Stop! (He runs down the steps as he protects Mordecai and Rigby with his arms.)

Jack: VICKI, berserker ion cannon! (VICKI prepares a large, blue energy ball) Now, Benson, brah. I don't wanna alarm you, but those are the perps.

Benson: (Circles around Jack) I know.

Jack: What?

Benson: They didn't steal my car. They're my employees. They took my car to get it fixed and didn't tell me. (Stops in front of the car)

Jack: But you told me I could do what I wanted with the perps. You promised! (Charges the energy ball even more. The others gasp.)

Benson: Look, Jack. There's no reason to hurt them. All I wanted was my car and it's right here. Just keep the money, OK? (Him and Jack stare each other down, sweating.)

Jack: Suit yourself, brah. (The others sigh) VICKI, shutdown code, alpha sigma row.

VICKI: (Beeps, misunderstanding the command) All systems go.

(Panicking, Jack waves VICKI in front of Benson, Mordecai, and Rigby. The energy ball shoots out of the cannon and all three scream)

Benson: Noooo! (In an effort to protect them, he pushes Mordecai and Rigby out of the way of the energy ball, which unfortunately hits his car and creates a massive explosion.)

(Fade back to outside the house, in daytime. Officers inspect a giant hole where Benson's car used to be.)

Jack: Woo! Bummer about your car, man. At least that explosion was pretty awesome. Totally satisfied my violent urges, you know what I'm saying? Hey, can I get the other 250 bucks?

Benson: Police!!

Jack: (Backing away) Rain check. Got it, brah. (Backlilps into the bushes while police officers chase him)

Benson: (Growls loudly to the sky, then turns to point at Mordecai and Rigby, creeping away) You!

Mordecai: (Nervously) Thanks for saving us, Benson.

Rigby: Yeah, thanks, man.

Benson: (Furious) DAMAGE TO THE HOUSE, DAMAGE TO MY CAR! MY BUS FARE FOR THE NEXT MONTH! YOU'RE PAYING FOR ALL OF IT!!! (He walks away.)

Rigby: He didn't say to clean up this mess, but...

Mordecai: (Sighs) Yeah, let's get started.

(They begin to clean when Rigby finds something.)

Rigby: Whoa, Mordecai, check this out. (Him and Mordecai pick up Benson's new windsheild, completely intact.)

Muscle Man: (Walks by them with Hi-Five Ghost) Told you my guy was good.

Mordecai: Whoooooooooooooaa! Loudest! I get to pick where we're eating!

Rigby: No way, dude. Check it. (moves around and a low rumble can be heard)

Muscle Man: You ladies got nothing. Hear it and weep. (hambones his stomach until a long, low rumble can be heard)

Rigby: That's cheating! You're pumping in a bunch of air!

Muscle Man: It's not cheating. It's called the Butterball Boxing Technique.

Hi Five Ghost: I got this, I got this. (tries to pressure himself) Aw, lost it.

(The guys then notice a commercial on TV)

Jimbros: ♪Jimbros burritos! Jimbros burritos! Jimbros burritos! Jimbros burritos!♪

Jimbo: We are the Jimbros! Jimbo!

Jimmy: Jimmy!

Jim: Jim!

Jimbo: Introducing our new Every Meat Buritto! It's got every meat! Beef!

(The Jimbros list a long line of meats and we are then shown how the burrito is made. All the meats mentioned come together in a ball. It then passes through a machine which cut the meat, and the meat is placed on the wheat flour tortilla and wrapped up.)

Jimbros: ♪Jimbros burritos! Jimbros burritos!♪

(The guys are stunned. Rigby gasps. We then see the guys driving the cart to Jimbros Burritos )

Guys: '♪Jimbros burritos! Jimbros burritos! Jimbros burritos!♪

(Muscle Man pullis up to the drive-thru.)

Muscle Man: We'd like 4 Every Meat Burritos, por favor.

Jimbo: Whoa, bro. Can't you see the sign? (Points to a sign that says 'No Car No Service)

Rigby: We're in a car.

Jimbo: Car, huh? Then where are the doors?

Mordecai: (pointing) That car doesn't have any doors.

(We see Jeremy and Chad sitting in a jungle car enjoying the burritos.)

Jimbo: That's a jungle car. Yours is meant for a golf course.

Rigby: For a park!

Jimbo: Don't come back here without a real car. (closes the drive thru window. The guys look at each other. The next scene shows the cart coming back, but with some cardboard attached to it.)

Muscle Man: 4 Every Meat Burritos-- (The wind picks up and the cardboard comes off the cart and flies away. Jimbo closes the drive thru window again. Scene cuts to Muscle Man driving the guys to his trailer.) Guess we'll have to take the Muscle Machine.

Rigby: Wait, I thought your car was busted.

Muscle Man: I just said that so you freeloaders would stop borrowing it all the time. (they walk to the car) There's nothing wrong with my sweet ride. She'll purr like a kitten when I start 'er up. (mirror breaks off. Rigby is about to say something, but...) JUST GET IN THE CAR!! (they all get in the car. Mordecai, Rigby and Fives cough and groan at the view of the car. Muscle Man tries to start the car, but it seems pretty hard.)

Mordecai: Try pumping the gas pedal.

Rigby: Pop the clutch.

Muscle Man: There is no clutch! It's automatic! (sighs) I just gotta finesee it. (tries to start the car again but fails.) Ugh!

Hi Five Ghost: Is the tank empty?

Mordecai: Maybe you need to jump.

Muscle Man: I said I gotta finesee it! And I can't do that with all this negative energy! (the guys stare at him. Muscle Man starts pressing down on the gas pedal) Come on, baby. Come to Papa! (uses his bare feet to work with the pedal) Come on! Come on! (with a perfect press, he finally gets it working. Everyone is impressed.) I told you! She runs like a dream. Now, let's go get some burritos!

(The guys start driving back to Jimbros.)

Guys: ♪Jimbros burritos! Jimbros burritos!♪

(The car suddenly clatters to a stop, and we can see that the oil is leaking out and the engine is fried.)

Rigby: Know anyone else with a car?

(A montage of the guys asking their friends for use of their vehicles begins. Skips declines use of his caravan, Pops declines use of Carmenita, Starla declines use of her car, John declines use of his truck, Gary declines use of his car and disappears. Of course, when they go to Benson's, he ultimately refuses to let the guys borrow his car.)

Benson: No way. The last time I let you borrow my car you totaled it. Do you think I'm crazy?! (closes his apartment door. Everyone looks at Mordecai)

Rigby: You just had to take Margaret to the airport, didn't ya?

Mordecai: (groans) Somebody's gotta have a car.

Muscle Man: Wait, the impound lot! Fives, doesn't your brother still work there as a cop?

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, I think so.

Mordecai: Do you think he can get us in?

Hi Five Ghost: I don't know. We haven't talked since he brought his girlfriend to Aunt Air Five's wedding.

Muscle Man: Come on, bro. Settle up and call him! We need this car! This is Every Meat Burritos we're talking about.

Hi Five Ghost: Ok, but those impound cars have some bad history.

(Scene cut to the City Impound Yard)

Low Five Ghost: Sure, I can help you out. It's the perfect car—lots of character.

Rigby: Cool! Which one is it?

(They look around at different cars)

Guys: Woah! Woah!

Low Five Ghost: There she is.

(We are shown a busted up looking car. The guys are unimpressed.)

Rigby: This car isn't gonna run. It looks like an old, dirty brick.

Low Five Ghost: Oh, it'll run. Back in the 70's it was used as a getaway car. (flashback to the 70's, where the car is freshly active) There was a crazy bank robbery. The police began hot pursuit. (The car drives into an alley and stops.) Two and a half hours later, they blocked him into an alley. With nowhere to run, they lawfully approached the vehicle. (The police walk up with their guns.) Only to find he had vanished.

Cop #1: We lost him...

Cop #2: What?! I hate it when people get away from uuuuuuus!

(Cops shoot at the vehicle. The flashback ends.)

Guys: Wooooaaaaaaaahhhhh! (They approach the vehicle.)

Rigby: Robber car!

Mordecai: This is gonna be awesome.

Rigby: What's this stuff on the seats?

Low Five Ghost: It's from the 70's. Everything made of shag carpeting.

Mordecai: You sure we can borrow it?

Low Five Ghost: Totally. We mostly use it for target practise and garbage. As long as you bring it back, no one's gonna notice.

Muscle Man: We'll take it!

(Cut to the guys on the road with the car.)

Rigby: Best part about 70s cars? We all get to ride shotgun.

(Muscle Man rolls up to Jimbo again.)

Jimbo: So you finally got a car. Or all least what's left of one.

Rigby: Come, on Jimbo. Less tood, more food.

Muscle Man: 4 Every Meat Burritos, extra every.

(Jimbo gives Muscle Man the order.)

Rigby: Are they really every meat?

Jimbo: We're out of llama, but we substituted smoked alpaca. You won't know the difference. (closes the window.)

(Mordecai and Rigby hmph as Muscle Man parks uo.)

Muscle Man: Gentlemen, I present (holds up bag) the Every Meat Burritos.

(Mordecai, Rigby and Muscle Man take a sniff.)

Mordecai: You can really smell the giraffe.

(A shadowy figure rises up in the backseat as Muscle Man opens up the bag. Fives takes a burrito.)

Hi Five Ghost: Let's do this! (figure grabs the burrito) What?

(The shadowy figure takes the bag from Muscle Man's hands.)

Muscle Man: Hey!

Mordecai: What's going on? (figure punches Mordecai in the face)

(The guys check the backseat.)

Rigby: There's a guy back there!

(The guy disappears into the seat into the seat with the burritos in hand.)

Muscle Man: (climbing over to the backseat) After him!

(Rigby climbs over too.)

Rigby: Aw, man! It keeps going!

(He dives deep into the backseat, followed by Muscle Man, Mordecai and Hi Five Ghost. The four start running through a long passageway with a whole bunch of garbage.)

Rigby: Ah, sick!

(They slow down for a while, and stop.)

Hi Five Ghost: Which way did he go?

Muscle Man: (sniffs) That way! (runs ahead with Hi Five Ghost) We're coming for you, you burrito-stealing loser! (steps on a spring with a board which sets off a trap, trapping him and Fives inside)

Mordecai and Rigby: Muscle Man! Fives!

(They run over to help them.)

Mordecai: We gotta get you outta there!

Muscle Man: No time! Just....get the burritos!

Hi Five Ghost: Yeahh, leave us! The burritos are the only things that matter!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm hmm! (run ahead as the walls get thicker)

Mordecai: Ugh, it's getting thicker!

Rigby: (spits) It's in my mouth!

Mordecai: Wait, I see light!

(Mordecai and Rigby enter a room.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah!

(Rigby sniffs around.)

Rigby: Show yourself! We know you're here! We can smell the burritos!

(The guys emerges from the walls.)

Barry: Guess ol' Barry couldn't run forever.

Rigby: Dude, you live down here? Gross!

Barry: What do you mean? This place is a paradise!

Mordecai: It's a nightmare. And it reeks.

Barry: Don't you say that about Barry's pad!

Rigby: Why are you living like this?

Barry: Oh, it's a bummer trip, man. I used to make my living on the land. (flashback to what he's describing) Rolling convenient stores, turning over banks. That's how we did it in the 70s. Easy money, dig? Then came that fateful day. The heat was on. I just couldn't shake Jonny Law. They cornered me. I had to bug out. Lay low in the shag. But they took my ride into impound. I couldn't escape! So I survived off the crumbs dropped by the fuzz over the years. (flashback ends) It was a bum rap, man.

Rigby: Heavy.

Barry: So when you fellas brought these burritos into my car, huh, I couldn't help myself. They smelled so outta sight, dig? Ol' Barry's gonna enjoy scarfin' these little numbers.

Mordecai: Except that we bought them, so they're ours. Now give 'em back!

Barry: Take your last whiff, cause it's all you're gonna get. (prepares to take a bite of the burrito)

Rigby: No! (charges at Beary, but misses)

Mordecai: Hey! Uhh.. (tries to hit Beary, but he karate-chops him whilst making a karate sound)

Rigby; Did he just karate-chop you?

Mordecai: Yeah, I guess, kinda.

Barry: (puts the burrito back in the bag) You want these burritos, you're gonna have to take em! (shakes his legs) Whooooooooooooaaaaaaaah! (starts making karate moves at Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai: What's he doing?

(Barry continues making karate sounds as he goes to sit on a chair, then he lies on the ground, grabs the chair, and kicks to toward Mordecai and Rigby, but it misses. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other, then back at Barry. He gets up and makes more strange poses before standing in front of Mordecai. Mordecai looks at Rigby before punching Beary in the face. Barry screams and falls back in slow motion, then moves toward Mordecai before getting punched again. He moves back and rolls around the bed before moving toward Mordecai again, and gets punched again. He then starts crashing and moving around before finally jittering on the bed and laying motionless with his eyes closed.)

Mordecai: (sighs) Would you just give us back our burritos?

(Barry releases the bag from hsi hand. Rigby goes ot pick them up.)

Rigby: You need to get outta here more often. The 70's aren't cool anymore.

Barry: (opens his eyes) Not cool?

Mordecai: Yeah, man. It's really nice outside. You should come enjoy the modern worlld with us.

Barry: You think it's safe? Are the fuzz still on my tail?

Rigby: Nah, I bet they don't even care anymore.

(Mordecai and Rigby climb out of the backseat.)

Mordecai: Come on out, Barry. It's alright.

Barry: (sticks his head out first, then his whole self) Whoa, man! The sun! (looks through the window) It's so bright.(takes a breath of air) And clean. (he, Mordecai and Rigby come out of the car) Yes sirree, it's gonna be a new life for ol' Barry!

Cop: (offscreen) On the ground, dirtbag! (punches Beay inn the face. Beary dramatically tries to fall back slowly) Alright, alright! (grabs him and holds him down to handcuff him)

Barry: Major bummer, man.

(Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Low Five Ghost appear.)

Low Five Ghost: Nice catch, guys.

Mordecai: Muscle Man! Fives! Are you okay?

Muscle Man: Fine, bro. That carpet put up a real fight, though. We had to crawl our way out.

Hi Five Ghost: I wanna take a shower.

Muscle Man; Once we got out, Fives dropped a dime to the guys at the station.

Low Five Ghost: Thanks for that tip, little brother. Gimme five! (they miss)

Muscle Man: So, did you save the Every Meat Burritos?

Rigby: (reveals the bag) Got 'em right here!

(The guys all reach for one.)

Mordecai: Best burrito ever.

Muscle Man: Hand it over!

Hi Five Ghost: I've been waiting for this!

(Rigby throws awway the bag. Mordecai and Rigby take a bite of their burritos, as do Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost. They enjoyingly chew them, but soon seem unsatisfied.)

Rigby: Hmm, taste like chicken.

Rigby: Chimichanga! (Mordecai moans) Dude!

(He throws the shirt at the back of Mordecai's head, which only makes him moan louder than before. Meanwhile, Rigby continues to throw more things to him)

Rigby (continued): Wake up! We gotta get chimichangas!

Mordecai: Huh? Right now?

Rigby: Yeah, now! I dreamt I was eating one, and everybody was there! Me, and you, and beans, and cheese; it was perfect!

Mordecai: Okay; a chimichanga does sound pretty good, actually.

Rigby: I just gotta grab something first.

(He then gets up from his trampoline.)

Rigby (continued):  It's good. You're gonna like it.

(Rigby tries to look for the item he needs by moving the trash down onto the floor, while Mordecai gets up from his bed and walks towards Rigby, watching him intently.)

Mordecai: You know, what I like to do is put my garbage in the trash can so I wouldn't dig through it when I need something.

Rigby: Whatever floats your boat, man.

(Rigby then finds the item he needed, which turns out to be two net hats that both say "IT'S CHIMICHANGA TIME!" on the front.)

Rigby (continued): Let's go.

(He then gives one of them to Mordecai.)

Mordecai: (Laughs) Aw, yeah; (Puts on the hat) it's chimichanga time!

(They both leave the room laughing, eager to get the chimichangas they've been wanting. Scene changes to Benson looking for his phone.)

(Benson sighs while Skips comes over to the door.)

Benson: Hey, Skips, have you seen my cell phone anywhere?

Skips: Didn't you lend it to Mordecai & Rigby?

Benson: Oh, right. They lost theirs in the toilet or something. (Benson & Skips leave the room.) How does that even happen?

(Scene then changes where Benson is knocking on Mordecai and Rigby's bedroom door.)

Benson (continued): Mordecai and Rigby, I need my phone back.

(Short silence)

Skips: You wanna take a look inside?

Benson: I don't wanna invade their privacy. I mean, I'm not even sure if it's in there.

(Skips then takes out his phone.)

Skips: Here, I'll dial your number and we'll see if we can hear it. (Skips dials the number) It's ringing. (pop music is heard in the scene) (laughs) Is that your phone?

Benson: It's the ringtone that came with the phone.

Skips: No, it isn't.

Benson: I just like it, okay? I'm going in.

(Benson then comes into the room and gags a little due to the horrible stench Mordecai & Rigby have in their room due to having huge piles of trash.)

Skips: I think the ring's coming from that pile.

(Benson then comes close to the pile which he sees his phone with stains and it's right on top of rotten food and clutter which makes Benson red and angry. The scene then changes to Mordecai & Rigby coming back with their chimichangas in the hallway.)

Rigby: (rapping) Some people play the bass!

Mordecai: (rapping) And some people play the conga!

Rigby: But I'm about to play...

Mordecai: ...this chimi-chimichanga!

Rigby: Turn up the treble!

Mordecai: Turn up the bass!

Rigby: Cause I'm shoving guacamole...

Mordecai: ...all up into my face!

(From their bedroom, Benson & Skips can hear both of them.)

Mordecai & Rigby: (rapping) Chimi-chimi-chimi-chimichanga! (Both laugh.)

Mordecai: Heh...classic. (The both of them then enter the bedroom.) Oh, hey, Benson. Hey Skips.

Benson: (angrily) You wanna explain why my phone is leaking?!

Mordecai: Oh, uh- sorry Benson.

Rigby: Yeah, we meant to give it back but then, a bunch...of...different stuff happened.

Benson: Bunch of different stuff? You mean like the garbage that's all over this room?

Mordecai & Rigby: Uhhh...

Benson: This place is a biohazard! I want both of you to clean it up now!

Mordecai: Both of us?! But Rigby's the one who's the slob! Look at his chimichanga!

(The screen shows Rigby's face with stains and his chimichanga dripping.)

Skips: He's not wrong.

Rigby: Well, Mordecai's even worse! Look at his junk at the corner!

(The screen then changes to Mordecai's bed.)

Mordecai: Dude, that's my bed.

Benson: I don't care who's responsible, (turning red) but you're gonna have to clean this room if you wanna keep living here, for FREE!

(The scene changes to Rigby chewing bubblegum while reading a trampoline magazine then spits out the chewed up bubblegum while Mordecai drops a package of trash bags on top of the magazine)

Rigby: Oh, hey, you dropped somethin'.

(Rigby holds up the package.)

Mordecai: It's time to clean the room. There are more of those in the kitchen and the dumpster's right outside.

Rigby: Well, you seem to know more around this maze so pretty well. Feel free around to get started.

Mordecai: Rigby, come on! This is your garbage! Just throw it out!

Rigby: Oh, really? My garbage? What about...(looks around in a pile)...this? (Rigby holds up a crumbled piece of paper) I almost never write on anything! This paper must be yours.

(Mordecai gets the crumbled paper from Rigby and un-crumbles it)

Mordecai: "Rigby's to-do list"? "Stay cool. Don't ever change. Have a great summer"?

(Rigby snatches the paper back and crumbles the paper again)

Rigby: Okay, fine. Garbage Hoops, then. Whoever misses the trash can first has to clean the room.

Mordecai: I'm not doin' this.

Rigby: Come on, Mordecai what's the big deal? It's just a little game. You're afraid of a little game?

Mordecai: This is your mess, Rigby. Just clean it up!

Rigby: But it's our room. What's yours is mine, what's mine is--

(Mordecai groans and snatches the paper back, flips the trash can over and slides it over to the other side of the room. He then throws the paper in a good aim to the trash can.)

Mordecai: Hm. Hm. Your turn.

Rigby: Okay, sure.

(Rigby gets another crumbled paper and then warms up for the throw by also grunting.)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: Alright! Alright!

(He then closes his eyes, pants a little then throws the paper as good as he could but ends up making him miss to hit at the center of the room.)

(Short silence)

Rigby: Later!

(By not liking the idea of him almost leaving, Mordecai tackles Rigby by not letting him get away that easy.)

Mordecai: Dude! Garbage hoops was your idea! You lost and now you have to clean the room! I'm leaving!

(Rigby glares while Mordecai leaves slamming the door shut, startling Rigby. Rigby whines while coming to get the trash can to clean the room while he mocks the things Mordecai has said about him before.)

Rigby: "Rigby's the one who's the slob! Look at his chimichanga!" Hmm! (He then lies down on his trampoline to check if there's any trash under it.) Hey... (Rigby gets up, comes near Mordecai's bed and kicks a toilet paper roll under it) I like it!

(scene changes where Mordecai comes into the room and sees that the room has no more piles of trash)

Mordecai: Whoa, good job, Rigby!

(When Mordecai had just put down his bag, a crumbling noise had appeared making him hear it, knowing that something's up. He checks under his bed cover and sees trash under it taking the whole space of his bed.)

Mordecai: Aw, dude!

(He checks the side table which also has garbage in it and by thinking of the obvious, he then opens the closet door which makes all the garbage fall right onto the floor making Mordecai sigh. Scene then changes where Rigby is coming through the hallway and got another chimichanga.)

Rigby: (rapping) Fried deep like a journal, a chimi-inferno, tortilla swaddled, wrapped so tight, I'm feeling paternal! (coming into the room, he sees that the garbage has been put up into their room again but this time making only one huge pile on Rigby's side) No! (Rigby drops his chimichanga, runs and picks up a pile of trash to put it under Mordecai's bed again but ends up going right forward to Mordecai) Aw, come on!

Mordecai: Just clean up the room, dude.

Rigby: Cleaning's for chumps!

Mordecai: Quit being a baby and clean it up!

Rigby: You quit being a baby and clean it up!

(scene then changes to Benson walking up the stairs with a salad.)

Benson: Lettuce, tomato, cucumber, and pepper. Salad for lunch and I never felt better. (laughs but then he comes close to their bedroom door and hears Rigby.)

Rigby: I'll never clean this room! Never!

(Benson comes in.)

Benson: This room is still not clean?!

Mordecai: But--

Benson: I'm sick of excuses! You have 24 hours to clean this room or you're fired!

(He leaves the room.)

Mordecai: This is on you, dude. Unless you wanna get another room, you better start cleaning.

(Mordecai leaves the room, shutting the door again. Rigby whines even more from his room to whining step by step down the stairs which Thomas hears feeling concerned when he then sees him on the couch now.)

Rigby: Hey, Thomas?

Thomas: Not gonna clean your room, dude.

(Rigby whines even more while Thomas tries to turn up the volume even more on the TV.)

Commercial: Bobby, why so glum?

Bobby: Mom's having another baby and I have to share my room with it.

Commercial: Another baby? Bummer, you should try 'Wall Buddy'! Wall Buddy lets you divide your space! Once! Twice! Even three times a room!

Bobby: Whoa! Wall Buddy's awesome!

Commercial: Buy now and you will receive Wall Buddy's voice activation at no additional charge!

(Bobby's baby brother is seen crying)

Bobby: Wall Buddy, help me out!

(Wall Buddy makes a wall around Bobby's brother.)

Commercial: Wall Buddy!

Bobby: Now my mom could have as many babies as she wants! Thanks, Wall Buddy!

(Bobby makes a wink making the end of the commercial)

Rigby: Great. Even that baby has his own room.

Thomas: Maybe you should get a Wall Buddy. Then you can be as messy as you want on your side of your room.

Rigby: Do they really work?

Thomas: Well, they're kind of cheaply made, but pretty much everyone in my dorm has one.

Rigby: Hmmm...

(scene changes to the hallway)

Mordecai: Alright, Rigby! The room better be clean!

(Mordecai comes into the room and sees that the room has a huge wall which is Wall Buddy, but the mess is still in there.)

Mordecai: What the—What's going on? (scene then shows Rigby lying down on his trampoline reading a book) What is this thing?

Rigby: Wall Buddy, window. I wanna see Mordecai's stupid face. (Wall Buddy then makes a window to Mordecai which Rigby demanded to do) Just decided to remodel a bit, thanks to Wall Buddy. Now we have our own rooms. Pretty awesome, right?

Mordecai: (sighs) Fine. You still need to clean up your mess though.

Rigby: My room is spotless, Mordecai. You might wanna get started on the huge mess in your room, though. I mean, Benson could fire you, so...

Mordecai: Dude! Dude, none of this is mine!

Rigby: Guess what, son! It's in your room so it's your mess now! Ha! Oh, you know what, my room could use some natural light. Wall Buddy, rearrange around other window.

(Wall Buddy does what Rigby has told it to do, taking part in Mordecai's space.)

Mordecai: Wall Buddy, rearrange around Rigby's mess! (Wall Buddy rearranges again taking all of the trash from Mordecai's space to Rigby's pushing it all the way to him.) Hmm! Hm!

(Rigby tries to get out from the pile making him pant a little.)

Rigby: Wall Buddy! Rearrange!

(Wall Buddy then rearranges pushing all the trash to Mordecai's side again but this time making all the trash go all the way to his corner making Mordecai squished in with the trash. Rigby laughs.)

Mordecai: (grunts) Wall Buddy! Window!

Rigby: Huh?

(Wall Buddy makes a window letting Mordecai punch Rigby in the arm.)

Rigby: Ow! (whimpers) Wall Buddy! Hatch!

(Wall Buddy does a hatch for Rigby making him kick Mordecai in the leg which makes Mordecai fall on the trash)

Mordecai: French doors! (Wall Buddy makes a door appear making all the trash go into Rigby's side) Rigby, I told you! (kicks piles of trash at Rigby's face at each saying) This...is...your...mess!

Rigby: Wall Buddy! Lower doorway!

(Wall Buddy lowers it a little due to hitting Mordecai's head in pain)

Mordecai: Ooh! (rubs his head) Wall Buddy! Hit Rigby with a buttress or something!

(Wall Buddy does what Mordecai has said until it's interrupted by Rigby)

Rigby: No! Hit Mordecai with abutting truss!

(Wall Buddy in a split second was about to do it but gets interrupted again)

Mordecai: No! Cancel abutting truss!

Rigby: Cancel buttress!

Mordecai: Cancel Rigby's commands!

Rigby: Cancel Mordecai's cancels!

(Wall Buddy is out of control by all the commands they told it to do at the same time)

Rigby: Uh, Wall Buddy, stop acting crazy! (Wall Buddy doesn't respond to them anymore and goes all around the room making a huge maze around them) Wall Buddy, stop subdividing! Wall Buddy!

(Wall Buddy keeps on dividing anyway by breaking through the walls in the hallway which also pushes Pops making him scream. Scene then changes to the living room where Thomas is watching the TV)

TV: And now, back to Carter & Briggs: Bust Russia.

Thomas: Alright!

(Wall Buddy then enters the living room still leading with Pops screaming right in front of it which blocks Thomas's viewing of the TV. Thomas sighs. Scene changes to where Muscle Man & High-Fives are stuck to a Chinese finger trap)

Muscle Man: How do we get out of this thing?

(By solving that problem, Wall Buddy gets through Muscle Man & High-Fives and later expands even more all over the house to the outside. Scene then changes to Mordecai & Rigby's bedroom )

Mordecai: (grunts) How are we gonna fix this now? Why didn't you just clean up your mess? (Mordecai pushes Rigby) It's like every time you have to do something simple you buy some dumb product and make it worst!

Rigby: What? When have I ever done that!? (screen shows some of Rigby's past products he brought up in the series like the Brain Max from "More Smarter" and The Russian from "One Pull Up". Rigby then slides the products away.) Anyway... (sighs) I'm upset!

Mordecai: Cause you got called out for being messy?

Rigby: No! That's not the reason why I'm mad! I know I'm messy. That's part of the "Rig package". It's 'cause you threw me right under the bus!

Mordecai: What? When?

Rigby: When Benson told us to clean the room, you ratted me out! It used to be both of us against the man. Now I know when it gets rough, you'll sell me out. Now my only buddy is Wall Buddy and you can see how well that's working out!

Mordecai: You're right. That was messed up. Bros gotta work out for one another. I'm really sorry, dude.

Rigby: I'm sorry, too.

Mordecai: Now how do we stop Wall Buddy?

Rigby: (gasp) The CPU!

Mordecai: What? What are you talking about?

Rigby: You know, that "pole-thingy". Maybe there's a reset button or something.

(Rigby leaves the room)

Mordecai: That's the plan?

(Mordecai leaves the room too to where Rigby's at. Scene changes where the both of them are in the hallway surrounded by Wall buddy)

Rigby: This way! (they then go to another hallway and go over a part of Wall Buddy) No, there's definitely a reset button! I read it in the manual!

(another part of Wall Buddy goes right in front of Mordecai)

Mordecai: Dude, you read something? I'm proud of you, man! (They then finally make it to the middle of the house seeing all the expansion of Wall buddy) Whoa...

Rigby: The CPU!

(They both see the CPU still expanding away from the house. Mordecai & Rigby then slide down on Wall Buddy to get close to the CPU)

Mordecai: Look!

(Mordecai points at the CPU which they are getting close to. Mordecai & Rigby then go running for it again)

Rigby: There!

(Getting even more close, they kept running and running after it when finally Mordecai & Rigby then hold onto the CPU but bringing matters worst, the CPU then brings up the two very high from above)

(Mordecai & Rigby scream)

Rigby: The reset button should be under the faceplate! We gotta smash it!

(By Rigby's words, Mordecai then smashes the faceplate)

Mordecai: Press it!

(Rigby then presses the button. Mordecai & Rigby scream again. Almost crashing to the ground, Mordecai & Rigby flip over on Wall Buddy but are still hanging on)

Mordecai: Hey, alright!

Rigby: Heh! He!

(since that was the reset button though, Mordecai & Rigby go all the way back again to the original position Wall Buddy was at which made Mordecai & Rigby scream at the whole experience back to their bedroom making Wall Buddy back to normal)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

(They both stand up)

Mordecai: Oh my gosh.

(Mordecai & Rigby high-five each other)

Rigby: Nice work, bro! And the best part is, Wall Buddy spread all my garbage throughout the park, so our room is spotless!

Mordecai: It also redistributed all our furniture.

Rigby: Well, yeah, but--

(Benson comes into the room red, screaming angrily)

Benson: MORDECAI & RIGBY!!!

Rigby: Now before you're saying anything, we did do what you said.

Mordecai: Yeah, we cleaned up Rigby's-- uh—I mean...our mess. (Rigby smiles in satisfaction) So you can't fire us.

Rigby: Immunity, son!

Benson: So who can I fire for ALL THE DAMAGE YOU TWO DID TO THE PARK?!?!?

Announcer: This is an emergency alert. A freak storm is moving towards the city. Citizens are advised to stay in.

Techmo:(Taking pictures) Haha, yes! Wait till the followers of my extreme weather blog see this.

(Through the camera lens,  multiple things are seen flying around the tornado then a hot air balloon comes into view)

Techmo: What the?

(Techmo zooms in and sees a man in the hot air balloon.)

Techmo: Oh, no.

(Scene goes to the Park and Benson is getting everyone into the basement.)

Benson: (Using megaphone) Okay everybody, this is not a drill. The tornado is gonna hit us in minutes, go, go, go!

Mordecai and Rigby: (Come around the corner) Wait up!

Benson: (Using megaphone) Whoa, you guys actually got the emergency supplies?

Rigby: We got every kind of pizza pouch son!

Mordecai: Pepperoni pizza pouch, sausage pizza pouch, pepperoni sausage pizza pouch.

Benson: All you brought were pizza pouches?!

Mordecai: Well, yeah. Check this out though, tornado ready pizza pouch.

Benson: I'll yell at you later. Now get in!

(The hot air balloon is seen crashing into the trees and the person is seen falling to the ground)

Benson: Oh my gosh!

(Benson and Rigby run to the guy)

Skips: Hey, what's going on?

Mordecai: Someone just ate it in the trees!

(Mordecai and Skips run to help Benson and Rigby.)

Benson: Lift!

(They lift the man, before bringing him into the basement and close the basement doors)

Skips: Spread out, spread out!

(They set the guy down and Mordecai pulls the hat up; it reveals that the guy is a yeti, he is completely lookalike of Skips, but much younger. Skips gasps in shock and disbelief and goes up to him)

Pops: Skips, who is that young rapscalien?

Skips: It's me.

(Everyone gasps and the lights go out; Scene goes to later when the tornado passes and the Park is wrecked from the storm)

Muscle Man: So you're teenage Skips from the 18th century?

Walks: Tis true, but my name is Walks.

Skips: He's from before I changed my name to Skips.

Benson: How did you get here?

Walks: I was with my friend Sampson, and we were engaging in my favourite pastime. Stormchasing.

(A flshback begins with a storm and a tornado is being approached by two hot air balloons.)

Walks: (laughs) What a thril!

Sampson: (drawing the tornado) Wait'll the readers of my bog book see this!

Walks: Sampson! Tis' unfortunate to be your log book, I'm flying closer to the tornado, or my name isn't Walks! Tally ho! (flies into the tornado)

Sampson: Walks, no! You are a novice! (echoes)

(flashback ends)

Walks: "You are a novice!" And that's the last thing I remember.

Skips: I don't know how you're here, but if we don't return you to the past, a whole chain of events will never happen.

Walks: What are you on about?

Skips: In the years after the balloon incident, you change your name, meet some giant baby, yadda yadda yadda, and spoiler alert: you become immortal. If you're here, that never happens. In 24 hours, time is gonna catch up to me and I'll age rapidly and die! (to Mordecai and Rigby) Eh, don't you guys have a time machine?

Rigby: Sure, we had a bunch of 'em. But Mordecai broke 'em over a girl who ended up leaving him.

Mordecai: Hey, it was meutral.

Rigby: That's what they all say.

(Mordecai punches him.)

Rigby (continued): Ow!

(Muscle Man is reading a newspaper.)

Skips: How about you, Muscle Man? You tend to know a guy.

(Muscle Man yawns.)

Muscle Man: Yeah, I know a guy with time machines. He's real good. His dad basically invented 'em.

Benson: Alright, so what are we waiting for?

Muscle Man: You got cash?

Benson: I'll do you one better.

(Benson shows Muscle Man a cheque book.)

Muscle Man: You know who else is easily impressed by cat cheques? My mom! Yes!

(Muscle Man and Fives laugh and hi five. They walk out with Benson)

Skips: Alright! You guys go, we'll keep an eye on Walks.

Walks: This grows tiresome. What's say we have a bit of fun? You there, what do you enjoy doing?

Skips: I like to read.

(He hands Walks a book. It's called Ukkeep and Repair of Phonographs.)

Walks: Ugh. Whatever events led me to be such a bore I hope to never find out.

(He spits on the book and hands it back.)

Mordecai: Hey, lay off! Skips is cool!

Rigby: Yeah, you should see the work he does!

Walks: Work?

Skips: General upkeep, repairs, landscaping, manual labour, helping people around the park.

(Walks suddenly gets up.)

Walks: Helping people? I'll never help people.

(He starts running off.)

Walks (continued): My name is Walks, as in Walks never helps people!

(Skips blocks the doorway.)

Skips: You can't leave!

Walks: Why do you arrest me so?

Skips: If you learn too much about our time, you could alter history.

Walkss: Nonsense.

(He tries to go through, but Skips still blocks him.)

Walks (continued): Release me!

Skips: It's for your own good!

Walks: Ye be not my father!

(He gives up.)

Walks (continued): To think I should turn into you. A doddering old fool with no sense of adventure. I'll never change my name to Skips.

(Skips winces for a bit.)

Skips: It's okay, you can't help being like this. You'll grow out of it one day.

(Walks just spits, shrugging it off. He goes over to Mordecai and Rigby, who are playing a video game.)

Walks: Hey there, chaps. Pray tell, uh, what are doing?

Mordecai: Playing video games.

(He holds up the game called "Hot Air Balloonerz 5000".)

Walks: My word!

(He sits down next to them.)

Mordecai: Yeah, man. Give it a try.

(He gives Walks the controller. Walks starts playing the game.)

Walks: Unbelievable! This device...is it powered by hot air as well?

(Rigby takes out a pizza pouch.)

Rigby: Totally. Here, slam one of these.

(Walks is given the pizza pouch. He opens and begins eating it.)

Walks: Tally-hooooooo! This is the future I can get behind!

(We pan over to Pops and Skips. Skips groans.)

Pops: Are you alright?

(Skips covers his face.)

Skips: Uh, yeah. I'll be fine.

(When he uncovers his face, it has aged. Pops screams at this.)

Skips (continued): What?

(Pops takes out a lollipop and shows it like a mirror. Skips sees his reflection.)

Skips (continued): No, no! The timeline is catching up.

(Muscle Man, Fives and Benson return.)

Muscle Man: No go, bro. Turns out my boy went back in time and bumped into his dad, and then his parents never met. I guess he faded from existence or something. You know how it goes.

Pops: Now what do we do?

(Mordecai and Rigby appear through the hallway.)

Mordecai: We've got some ideas.

Rigby: Yeah, we can order one. It only takes six weeks to ship. Or was is six months?

Mordecai: I've heard good thing about the Bermuda Triangle.

Skips: No, no! The only way is to catch up to the storm. Send him back the way he came.

Rigby: I was totally about to suggest that.

Mordecai: Yeah. Let's do that.

Skips: It's impossible without state-of-the-art stormchasing equipment.

Pops: Oh, I've got some.

(He holds it up.)

Skips: No. There's only one person who has what we need, and I don't even know if he still chases storms.

(Techmo opens the door.)

Techmo: Did you see it?

Skips: Techmo!

Walks: Sampson!

Techmo: When I saw the balloon, I knew to come here.

(He replays the scene from the camera on his arm.)

Techmo (continued): Oh no, Skips' balloon. I need to go to the park.

Mordecai: So you know about the tornado?

Techmo: Timenado. I was with Walks when he caught in the 1700s.

(He projects a screen with his eye.)

Techmo (continued): It was the baddest storm we ever chased. And now it's back.

Rigby: You're a technomancer and a storm chaser?

Techmo: Yes.

Rigby: Could you be any cooler?

Techmo: Does having a panini maker in my arm answer your question?

(He reveals it.)

Rigby: Uh huh.

Techmo: There'll be plenty more time to compliment me later. We got a timenado to catch.

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Walks and Techmo: Tallyhoooo!

(Cut to outside. Muscle Man, Fives, Thomas, Pops and Benson wave as the Delerean DMC-12 takes off toward the timenado with Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Walks and Techmo inside.)

Walks: What matter of carriage is this? Where have you hidden the horses?

Mordecai: Uh, it's a secret.

(Behind him and Rigby, Skips' chair turns around. He falls to the ground, stable and still aging.)

Mordecai, Rigby, Techmo and Walks: Skips!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Walks go to him.)

Techmo: Mordecai, I need you to take the console.

(Mordecai does so. Rigby and Walks continue to support him.)

Rigby: Dude, he's fading.

Techmo: Talk to him!

Walks: Uhh, stop dying, you old fool!

(Skips groans.)

Techmo: Uh, Skips, remember when I was possessed by a computer virus, and then we had an epic sledgehammer battle?

(Skips laughs weakly.)

Walks: What? Did that really happen?

Mordecai: How about when you defeated Klorgbane with the Fists of Justice?

Skips: Yeah, that was awesome.

Rigby: Or, or, when you saved our skins by being mind-blowingly heroic? Which is like, every day.

Walks: Huh. Perhaps you aren't as meek as I thought.

(He pats Skips.)

Walks (continued): Eh, nice work.

(Skips smiles and closes his eyes. Mordo is looking through the radar.)

Mordecai: Techmo, it's moving into delta quadrant!

Techmo: Roger.

(He takes a right turn.)

Techmo (continued): Talk to me.

Mordecai: North east!

(Techmo drives off the road and on the shore. Rigby, Skips and Walks scream. Techmo eventually gets back onto the road.)

Techmo: Timenado visual confirmed!

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips and Walks: Whooooaaa.

(They approach the timenado. We see a closeup of it, panning from bottom to top. Many objects are revolving around the timenado. Techmo swerves his car as some objects nearly hit him. It is now ahead of the timenado.)

Techmo: Proceed with Phase 2.

(Mordecai pushes a button, causing the car's boot to burst open, revealing a hot-air balloon. The sunroof is also open.)

Techmo: Alright, Walks! Once you're in your balloon, Mordo and Rigs'll ease you into the core of the timenado! You'll find a portal home there!

(As Techmo says this, Walks listens while Mordecai and Rigby put up a ladder for the balloon, the former climbing up through the sunroof. Walks approaches the near-ending Skips.)

Walks: Skips, I can tell that living our life will be the greatest adventure of all, But I'm still not changing my name.

Skips: You just gotta...(inhales) meet the right girl.

(Walks smiles and pats Skips before heading off. He bumps into a box of pizza pouches that tumble out. He licks his lips at the sight. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby at the balloon. Walks comes climbing through the sunroof.)

Mordecai: Walks! What took ya?

Walks: Nothin'!

(He runs into the hot air balloon, his arm over his jacket. Mordecai notices this.)

Mordecai: Hey! Do you have something under your jacket?

Walks: Art thou a judge? Am I on trial here?

(A pizza pouch falls out of his jacket. Rigby gasps.)

Rigby: Dude! Our pizza pouches!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump into the balloon. Rigby puts down the control.)

Rigby: Hand 'em over and nobody gets-

(Walks punches him, causing his elbow to hit the "release" button, releasing the balloon, connected to a wire with Mordecai, Rigby and Walks on it as it flies around the Timenado. Techmo notices an error.)

Techmo: What the...

Car Voice: Auto-pilot.

(Techmo runs out of his seat as Skips gasps weakly, then Techno jumps out of his car and sees the balloon flying around the Timenado)

Techmo: What a mess!

(A viking boat falls and gets tangled up with the wire as Walks touches the lever to make the balloon go higher. Techmo draws out his sword, hops on the viking boat and cuts the wire off, making the balloon go into the Timenado as Techmo's car stops. As balloon gets inside the Timenado, a giant crystal at the center of the Timenado creates portals through time.)

Walks: Look! (Points to a portal to the 1700s where Sampson is on his hot air balloon looking for Walks.)

Sampson: Walks! Walks! (sees Walks) Walks!

Walks: Let's go!

(A Great Sphinx head hits the balloon, causing to knock Walks off, but Mordecai and Rigby grab him as the 1700s portal is slowly closing)

Sampson: We don't have much time! Hurry!

(Mordecai and Rigby swing Walks to the portal, sending him through the portal back to the 1700s and Walks lands on Sampson's hot air balloon as the portal closes. Skips returns to normal age.)

Skips: Can this thing fly?

Techmo: Does this answer your question?

(Techmo presses the "yes" button as his car flys to the Timenado to save Mordecai and Rigby, who are still in it. As Mordecai and Rigby hang on to Walks' hot air balloon, a portal opens to reveal a high school as past versions of Mordecai and Rigby walk by and notice it.)

Past Mordecai: Dude, check out this portal, dude. It looks like older us.

Mordecai: It's us in high school!

Rigby: No! Anything but that!

(Techmo's car flies into the Timenado as Mordecai and Rigby are about to be sucked into the portal, but Skips saves them and the car flies back to the park. Mordecai and Rigby get out of the car.)

Skips: Thanks, Techmo.

Techmo: Hey, now we're even.

(Skips gets out of the car as Techmo drives off as the techno remix of "Yankee Doodle" plays briefly before the car disappears.)

Pops: Everyone, Skips is back!

(He, Benson, Muscle Man, Fives and Thomas run up to Skips)

Pops: Thank goodness you're alright.

Benson: Good to have you back, Skips. (Shakes Skips' hand)

Muscle Man: Don't go almost dying on me again, bro.

Skips: Eh, I'll see what I can do. (as Mordecai and Rigby are about to walk away) Mordecai and Rigby, come with me.

(We cut time Skips' house where Skips opens his attic with ladders come out of it and they climb up the attic.)

Skips: Uh, let me get the light. (Turns on the light to reveal ancient artifacts from his travels around the world)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Mordecai: Skips, this is incredible. You kept mementos from all of your adventures?

Skips: Yeah. But this one's for you guys.

Benson: Here you go, Thomas. Try that. (Hands him a glass)

Thomas: (Drinks) Amazing. It tastes just like water.

Benson: That's because it is water. 100% safe drinking water from the dew I collected this morning. You can last for months with just the knowledge I've shared today.

Pops: Bravo!

(Everybody claps)

Pops: Is it really pure dew?

Benson: Sure is. Here, let me show you my system.

(Everybody gets up and leaves except for Mordecai and Rigby, who are busy playing video games.)

Rigby: Can you guys keep it down? All this "pure dew" talk is blowing my fo- oomph!

Mordecai: Mmm!

(Rigby grunts as they play intensely. Mordecai soon wins, causing Rigby to groan.)

Mordecai: Haha, OOOOOOHHHHHH! Good game, dude, good game.

Benson: Guys! Can you come here for a second?

Mordecai: Aw sweet, Benson's presentation is over.

Rigby: Look out face, it's time to shove some burgers in your mouth!

Mordecai: Yeah, watch out buns, 'cause you're about to get some patties up in you. 

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh simultaneously and walk over to Benson.) 

Benson: Hey guys, thanks a lot for coming to this. I know my wilderness survival presentations aren't how you'd normally choose to spend your time off. 

Mordecai: Sure, Benson. No problem. 

Benson: Great. So, if you can just bring over the tortillas I'll get started on the food. 

Rigby: No offense, but you don't make burgers with tortillas. 

Benson: (Eyes narrowing) Wait. Are you telling me that you didn't bring the tortillas?

Rigby: Why would we bring tortillas for burgers?

Benson: Because we're not having burgers, we're having quesadillas.

Rigby: Ah, what?! We only came to this thing for the burgers at the end! 

Mordecai: Yeah, why didn't you tell us we were having quesadillas this time? 

Benson: I did tell you, over and over! I said we're having quesadillas this time! 

(Flashbacks to Mordecai and Rigby playing video games.)

Benson: Don't forget, we're havin' quesadillas this time, so, if you can pick up the tortillas I'd really appreciate it. 

Mordecai: (Distracted) No problem. 

(Flashbacks to Benson knocking on Mordecai and Rigby's bedroom door while Mordecai and Rigby are playing a video game inside.)

Benson: Hey guys, you're gonna pick up tortillas for the quesadillas, right? 

Rigby: (Wins gold in the game) Aw, YES! 

Benson: Great, thank you. 

(Flashbacks to Mordecai and Rigby walking down The House's steps while playing portable video games. Benson then comes from inside the house to speak to them.) 

Benson: Since you guys are headed out anyway, this might be a good time to get those tortillas. 

Rigby: What did he say? 

Modecai: I think, uh...have a good time? 

(Cuts from flashback)

Mordecai: Maybe if you just reminded us one more... (Benson throws his hat in Mordecai's face.) Uh!

Benson: I shouldn't have to remind you at all! You two never listen to me and I'm sick of it! 

Rigby: Don't be mad, Benson. 

Benson: Mad? I got mad the last time you ignored me. This time I'm...I'm...deeply offended! And now, I have six pounds of cheese and not one tortilla! What kind of quesadilla can you make with that, huh?! (Turns red) WHAT KIND?! 

Skips: You can't make a quesadilla without tortillas; that's just cheese.

Benson: Thank you, Skips. So now, because of Mordecai and Rigby, here we all are, tired, hungry, nothing to eat. And if you two don't get those tortillas right now, [red] YOU'RE FIRED!

(Cut to the Grocery store. Mordecai and Rigby stand at the aisle with tortillas.)

Rigby: (Feels around the tortilla bags) Well, which ones are we supposed to get? There's like thirty different kinds here.

Mordecai: How should I know?

Rigby: Well, can you check?

(Mordecai takes a piece of folded paper out from his handbag and opens it.)

Mordecai: It's a note from Benson. "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, you're probably standing there like two boneheads trying to figure out which of the thirty different kinds of tortillas to get."

Rigby: How does he know?

(Rigby takes the note from Mordecai.)

Rigby (continued): Dude, he typed it. "Since you never listen, I'll remind you that we need an extra large bag of Casa Queso Handmade Style Flour Tortillas. If you come back here with anything else, you're fired. Your boss, Benson." And then there's some clipart of a bomb and it says, "The clock is ticking."

(Rigby shows it to Mordecai, and they laugh. Mordecai grabs the correct tortillas.)

Mordecai: "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, go get the exact tortillas I want, or I'm gonna get all mad".

(They laugh as they leave. We cut to them driving the cart on the road.)

Mordecai (continued): "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, I know you love burgers, so we're having quesadillas".

(They laugh)

Rigby: Yeah. "Dear Mordecai and Rigby, if I don't get something to put this cheese between right now, you're fired!"

(They laugh again.)

Mordecai: Dude, we're actually running kinda late on getting these tortillas back to the park.

Rigby: Yeah. Maybe we should take that new shortcut.

Mordecai: Good call.

(He makes a left turn into the shortcut, straight into the forest.)

Rigby: And then earlier Benson was all like, "Don't forget to gas up the cart before you get tortillas!" And I was just like, "Cool, dude. Thanks for the....heads.....up?"

(The cart suddenly comes to a stop.)

Mordecai: I see. (Turns the cart key, but it doesn't start up) Dude, why didn't you just listen to Benson and gas up the cart?

Rigby: Because he never says anything important?

Mordecai: Except that was important, 'cause now we're stuck in the middle of the woods! Argh! (Sighs) Okay, this is gonna be painful, but I think we have to ask Benson to come get us. (Grabs the cart's radio) Guys? Hey? Benson? Are you there?

(No response comes, but a fart is suddenly heard.)

Rigby: Sorry.

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: I really am sorry, Mordecai! My body just starts talkin' when it's hungry.

Mordecai: (Sighs and drops the radio) Just give me the phone. (Rigby reaches under himself, grabs the phone, and hands it to Mordecai. Mordecai blows on it repeatedly, then checks it.) Awesome. No service. We're gonna have to walk the rest of the way.

(Cuts to them walking through the forest, with Mordecai holding the tortillas. They then stop when they see a fork in the road.)

Mordecai: I'm pretty sure if we just head towards those trees... (They walk in the path he chose and we cut to the two struggling through branches and leaves, getting dirty in the process. They then walk into an open area, with Rigby pulling leaves out of his tail.) Okay. That didn't land us where I thought it would. But if we could just get to the other side of that river... (Cuts to them carefully walking across a shallow river, only to stop at a dead end. Cuts to them walking across the river again in the opposite direction while Rigby growls to himself.) All right, so, I think if we can go down that hill...

(Cuts to the two stepping down a steep hill)

Rigby: Easy...easy...

(They both suddenly slip and fall down the hill, yelling. We pan to the sky, and it transitions to nighttime. Pans back to Mordecai and Rigby walking through more woods)

Mordecai: Okay, maybe if we-

Rigby: (Angrily) Maybe if we what? You even have any idea where we're going? I've seen that Skips rock four times!

(Shows the Skips-like rock)

Mordecai: Okay, but-

Rigby: Dude, just face it. We're lost!

Mordecai: Yeah, we're lost.

Rigby: And I'm cold and hungry!

Mordecai: Well, I'd say we go back to the cart for shelter, but I don't even know where that is any more. (Rigby suddenly starts eating a tortilla.) What're you doing? You can't eat those, we have to give 'em to Benson! (Takes the tortilla)

Rigby: Well, he's not gettin' anything if we die up here!

Mordecai: But maybe there's something else we can eat. (Looks around and finds a pile of rocks) Can we eat...rocks?

Rigby: I saw one show where the guy made a three-course meal out of nothing but tree bark.

(Mordecai's stomach growls, then they run to a nearby tree and start eating the bark.)

Mordecai: It's not that bad. (Turns to Rigby) Whoa, dude... (Mordecai's vision has turned everything pixelated.)

Rigby: (Turns to Mordecai) Huh? (Stops eating and looks unsure) That's not right, man. (Rigby's vision has turned Mordecai in a burger with a tortilla for buns.)

Mordecai: What show did you see that bark thing on?

Rigby: (Scratches chin) It was on, um... Oh, Crazy Eats.

Mordecai: The one where the guy makes himself insane by eating stuff that's not food? Rigby, they don't even go outside on that show!

Rigby: But Mordecai, the inside is the outside. (The tree disintegrates and we zoom into Rigby's eye as he repeats, "The inside is the outside.")

(A stream of hallucinations occur as the two are affected by the tree bark. They then fall onto the ground in the forest, weak. They sit back up, and Mordecai brushes himself off.)

Rigby: (Holding his head) Aw, man... What happened?

Mordecai: I don't know, dude. But we're not gonna survive this, are we?

Rigby: (Wraps around himself) Dude, it's so cold!

Mordecai: (Shaking) We're gonna freeze to death before we can get Benson these tortillas...

Rigby: If Skips was here, he'd know what to do!

(Flashbacks to them back at the camping area, in Rigby's perspective. Benson is instructing safety tips.)

Skips: Pay attention, guys. You're gonna need to remember this stuff.

(Cuts back to the present, and Rigby gasps)

Rigby: Mordecai! We need to remember what Benson said in his wilderness presentation!

Mordecai: (Places down the tortillas) Dude, that's it!

Mordecai and Rigby: Remember, remember...

(Flashbacks to Rigby's perspective again, playing a video game. He struggles as he tries to look up at Benson instructing, and Thomas in a bear costume.)

Benson: ...And that's how you survive a bear attack. (Shakes hand) Thank you, Thomas. (Thomas walks away) Hey, Mordecai and Rigby, I need your eyes up here!

Pops: (Raises hand) Oh, Benson. What about when it gets chilly?

Benson: That's a great question, Pops. Now, it may look like I'm just wearing a jacket up here. (Unzips the green jacket) But underneath it, I have on a sweatshirt, followed by a long-sleeve thermal, followed by a t-shirt, followed by a tank top. It's called 'layering', and your key to temperature regulation.

(The flashback ends, and we're back at the woods.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Layering! (Looks around)

Mordecai: There's nothin' to make layers with.

Rigby: I see some layers.

(Shows the bag of tortillas. Clock transition to the two layered up with tortillas. Rigby tries to grab more out of the bag, but Mordecai takes it away, making him whine.)

Mordecai: That's enough for now. We need to save the rest for Benson.

(Wind blows, making Rigby shiver and cross his arms.)

Rigby: We better get a move on.

(The two begin to hike through the forest, starting a montage. Using tortillas as snowshoes, Mordecai walks over to a river and scoops up water with another tortilla. Once he drinks it, he spits it out in disgust. Rigby taps his shoulder to grab his attention, then tries to remember more from the presentation. Recalling on how Benson used dew for drinking water, they mimic him and drink some dew. Cutting to a mountain, we see them carefully stepping downwards. Worrying, Rigby starts to remember what Benson showed on how to climb down mountains, and they copy the method. Transitioning to the woods at night, Mordecai holds a rod of tortillas and strikes it against a tree, making a torch to scare away a bear. Rigby twists his rod of tortillas into a spear, and they chase away the bear. Back into daytime, they walk through the woods some more as Rigby leaves a tortilla trail. Cutting to a river, a bearded Rigby is shown fishing and an equally bearded Mordecai brings in a net full of fish, much to their happiness. They remember how Benson had shown how to catch large amounts of fish with a net, and Rigby nods to Mordecai in approval. Cutting to Rigby sitting on a rock, he tries to make glasses out of tortillas. Noticing that he just used up the last of the tortillas, he and Mordecai go back through the woods to pick up the tortilla trail. Cuts to Mordecai stirring a green liquid with a tortilla bowl and spoon. He spreads the liquid on a giant infection on Rigby's leg. We then cut again into nighttime, with Mordecai warming his hands around a campfire and Rigby leaning against a tree near a tent made of tortillas. It suddenly begins to snow. Switching to a snow-filled area, Rigby is on a tortilla sled being pulled by Mordecai. He writes weakly into a tortilla journal that states, "DAY 37".)

Rigby: "End is near. Tell Benson we tried." (Pants and groans as he closes the journal and rests his eyes)

(Mordecai groans as he drops the rope and neals to the ground.)

Rigby (continued): (Weakly) Did we make it?

Mordecai: No...

Rigby: (Sighs) It wasn't supposed to end like this, Mordecai. (Coughs roughly)

Mordecai: (Holds Rigby's face and says, tiredly:) No, Rigby. Don't give up. There's gotta be one last thing we can remember from Benson's presentation.

Rigby: No, bro. This is it. See you on the other side... (He closes his eyes with his hands, but Mordecai opens them again.)

Mordecai: Please, just try to remember, Rigby! Do it for Benson.

(Rigby groans as he remembers Benson demonstrating with a phone.)

Benson (in flashback): And if all else fails, find a cell phone signal. It may just save your life one day.

Rigby: (Suddenly full of excitement) We have to find a cell phone signal!

Mordecai: (Pats around himself) Okay, okay, let me just- (He pulls a phone from behind him and gasps, as the phone only has one percent of battery life left.) It's almost out of batteries...!

Rigby: (Busts out of tortilla blanket) Then, let's go!

(Mordecai starts to run with the phone above his head, trying to catch signal, while Rigby limps behind him. Mordecai checks the phone, which only has 0.4% battery life remaining. As he puts the phone in the air again, Rigby limps harder.)

Rigby: Mordecai! (Pants) My leg... (Pants) I can't!

Mordecai: Yes, you can! This is our last chance, Rigby! Are you gonna die like a little baby or are gonna help me?

Rigby: I-I-I'll help you, Mordecai!

(Cuts to Mordecai holding Rigby up high, running, as Rigby holds the phone higher in the air.)

Mordecai: Anything?!

Rigby: Run faster!

(They both yell as they run away from the snowy field and into the woods.)

Rigby: Come on, phone--please, please, please! (Gasps as a small shred of signal is found) A bar, Mordecai! We have a bar!

Mordecai: (Eyes watering) A bar?

Mordecai and Rigby: (Chanting) A bar! A bar! (Laughs hysterically)

Mordecai: Ugh, wait, call dude! Call!

Rigby: (Starts to dial) Okay! Shh, shh, shh! I'm dialing! (Gasps as the phone makes a tone) It's ringing!

(As the phone calls, a ringtone is heard. Their faces fall as we pan to all of the other guys standing a few feet in front of them. Benson is holding his phone as it rings, then slowly brings it to his face as he answers it.)

Benson: Hello...?

Mordecai: (Puts Rigby down) I can't believe it. You guys are still here! After all this time?

Rigby: (Tiredly) Everything has changed so much since we've been gone... (Picks up pine cone) Is this still called a...pine cone?

Mordecai: What year is it?

Thomas: You guys have only been gone a couple hours.

Skips: We could hear you yelling on the other side of those trees. But every time we had Thomas go check it out, you attacked him.

Benson: (Holds up Rigby's filthy tortilla jacket) These tortillas are soggy and dirty.

Rigby: (Runs up to Benson and grabs his leg) Oh, Benson, you saved us!

Mordecai: (Takes off tortilla hat) Yeah, Benson. We're sorry we never listen.

Rigby: And you're so smart! How did you know we were gonna forget what tortillas to get?

Benson: (Pushes off Rigby) All right, all right, that's enough! I had a feeling this might happen. (Turns to the group) Thomas, can you take the back-up burgers over to the grill, please?

Mordecai and Rigby: (Hopefully) Back-up burgers? (Raises arms) Whooaaaaa!

Benson: Just don't touch any of the food.

Benson: Private property boys, hit the road. 

Kid: Is that... Are you a cop?

Benson: I'm not a cop, I'm your worst nightmare. (The kids throw eggs at Benson, but he dodges them)  Hey! Hey, stop it!

Kid: Nice costume, loser! 

(The kids both laugh, pick up their bags and run away. Then Benson goes back to his cart and starts chasing them. Scene pans to Pops' House, where a Halloween party is going on. The scene changes to various parts of the house filled with guests doing various activities; one man is sliding down the banister of the stairs.)

Man: Happy Hallow- (Falls off of the banister. Scene changes to Thomas telling a story to the other park workers, except for Pops and Benson.)

Thomas: But the maniac was calling from outside the house! Wait, is that right? I mean, I mean, inside the house! (The other park workers groan at the story and throw their soda cans at him)

Muscle Man: Bad Thomas, bad! Seriously, that made my ears sad, bro. 

Mordecai: There's no way you're winning the bet. (Pops walks over)

Pops: Bet?

Skips: Yeah, Pops, whoever tells the scariest story wins the pot; our Halloween candy!

Pops: Ooh!

Rigby: And whoever tells the worst story, probably Thomas, has to wear their costume until Thanksgiving.

Pops: Oh ho ho ho! What a humdinger of a bet!

Mordecai: Your turn, Rigby. Candy up!

Rigby: Hmph. Hmph. (Rigby pours his candy on the pile) Okay. We open on Mordecai eating cereal.

News Reporter: And so, people with beds are at threat level: Beds. (Somebody gives the reporter a piece of paper) This just in, police forensic experts have tracked the specific bed with the murderer in it. If your bed has the following SKU, you are sleeping on a killer. (Camera zooms onto the bed SKU, scrolling as the reporter reads out the number) 623570406.... umm, well, this last number's kind of smudged, I can't really make it out. It's an... 8! An 8.

Rigby: NOOOO!

(Johnny cackles, swallowing Rigby with the duvet. Cut to the kitchen, where the groundskeepers are playing cards.)

Muscle Man: What's the deal with Rigby?

Mordecai: Oh, he got a new bed or something. Nobody cares, dude!

(Rigby is screaming, and rips the covers in half)

Rigby: I could use a little help, guys!

Mordecai: It's just a bed, dude! You sleep in it!

(Rigby is still screaming)

Mordecai: Urgh! That's it! (Throws his cards onto the table in anger, then walks up the stairs) Rigby! Stop messing around!

(Johnny spits Rigby onto the wall. Johnny grabs a wrench.)

Mordecai: What the...?! Rigby! Careful with that Allenwrench! (He tries to attack Johnny, but gets knocked back) Urgh! That was a firm mattress...

(The groundskeepers run in)

Benson: What's going on?

(Johnny grabs Rigby)

Johnny Allenwrench: Back off, man, or the kid gets wrenched!

(The guys gasp)

Mordecai: Dude, he's super strong, Benson.

Benson: Well I got powers, too. Powers of negotiation! Let Rigby go!

Johnny Allenwrench: You'll call the cops.

Benson: We won't call the cops if you let him go. Right guys?

Guys: Nah. No way.

Mordecai: Why would we?

Johnny Allenwrench: I've been on the run for so long. I'm just tired, man.

Benson: Look, I'm the park manager here. I can give you a job.

Johnny Allenwrench: You'd do that? You'd do that for old Johnny Allenwrench?

Benson: Yeah. You won't have to run anymore.

(Johnny drops his wrench and lets Rigby go. The groundskeepers cheer.)

(Benson shakes Johnny's hand in agreement)

Benson: You'll start tomorrow.

The Next Day

(Johnny is watering the flowers and humming)

Rigby: NOW!

(All of the groundskeepers, except Benson and Rigby, attack Johnny with axes)

Benson: Way to plan that ambush, Rigby.

Rigby: Way to lie to his face, Benson.

Benson: Hey, it's called negotiating.

(He and Rigby laugh)

Benson: Rigby, you're getting ALL the promotions.

(He high fives Rigby)

Rigby: YES!!

PROMOTION! (Rock music plays)

Muscle Man: Wait, did he just say Rigby was getting ALL the promotion—

THE END (Rock music plays again. End of "Killer Bed".)

Rigby: (He mimics the rock music) Now that's a story, fools!

(Everyone except Muscle Man agrees)

Muscle Man: Eh, I can do better.

Rigby: What?! Why don't you put your candy where your mouth is.

Muscle Man: So you want me to eat it?

Rigby: No! I mean put it on the table.

Muscle Man: That's what I thought you meant.

Rigby: Then do it then!

Muscle Man: I will! (Muscle Man pours his candy on the pile) This one's gonna make you have to change your chonies.

Rigby: Man, disposing all of these pumpkins is the best job Benson ever gave us. (He smashes a pumpkin)

Muscle Man: It's times like this, I know I'm in the right profession. (He smashes a pumpkin)

Mordecai: Oh man, last one. (A huge pumpkin is sitting right next to them)

Rigby: How do we even... I mean, what do we even...

Muscle Man: I know what to do.

(Muscle Man drives a cart and smashes the last pumpkin, eventually heading into some fog as the gang laugh)

Hi-Five Ghost: Hey, where are we?

Mordecai: I don't know it looks like some kind of... (They approach a pumpkin patch) abandoned pumpkin patch?

Muscle Man: Alright, bros, we hit the jackpot! This party just got a whole lot pumpkiny-er!

Mordecai: Are you sure we're supposed to smash these? This is pretty far away.

Muscle Man: I take my orders very seriously. Benson said all the pumpkins.

Rigby: Woah, check that out.

(They see two pumpkin scarecrows dressed like pilgrims on two poles)

Muscle Man: (To the pumpkin scarecrows) Hey, where did you get those clothes? Out of my mom's trash? (Laughs)

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing?

Muscle Man: This is the perfect time to brush up on my crowd work. (To the pumpkin scarecrows) Hey, it's just a joke. You seem a little stuck up. Stuck up on that pole!

(As Muscle Man is making jokes, Rigby walks over to the scarecrows and reads a plaque that has been placed between them.)

Rigby: "Smash all you want, but leave these two pumpkin lovers alone". Aw, man. That just makes me wanna smash 'em more!

Muscle Man: Then let's do it! It's the Circle of Life, or whatever.

Mordecai: I think we should go...

(Everbody starts complaining)

Hi-Five Ghost: Awwww...

Muscle Man: What?

Rigby: But we're supposed to!

Mordecai: ...Go smash these pumpkins!

Muscle Man, Hi-Five Ghost, & Rigby: That's what I thought!

(The gang knocks the female pumpkin scarecrow down with rocks, laughing)

Muscle Man: Alright, I got this one. (He jumps on the female scarecrow and smashes her, which is shown in slow motion. This causes debris to splatter all over the male scarecrow.)

Mordecai & Rigby: (In slow motion) WOAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!!!

(Muscle Man high fives Fives)

Muscle Man: Now go for the dude!

Hi-Five Ghost: Haha, okay.

Mordecai, Rigby, & Muscle Man: Fives! Fives! Fives!

Hi-Five Ghost: Uuuuhhhhhhhhh.........

Muscle Man: Just do it bro!

Hi-Five Ghost: Okay, I'll just grab his head now.

(As Fives is about to grab the male scarecrow's head, he comes to life and grabs Fives's arms. Fives screams in terror.)

Scarecrow: YOU! (Fives screams and Fire is coming out of his mouth and eyes) You smashed my hot wife! (The fire fades out, revealing his glowing red eyes and mouth) Now you will reap what you've sown!

Mordecai: Fives, just phase through, man!

(Before Fives can do that, however, the scarecrow turns him into a solid pumpkin) 

Scarecrow: You boys want to smash some pumpkins? Let's smash some pumpkins! (He smashes Hi-Five Ghost and collects the seeds)

(The guys scream. Muscle Man quickly puts his hands over his mouth to stop himself from throwing up. The scarecrow laughs evilly.)

Muscle Man: Scatter! (The gang run away into a cornfield in separate paths, making the scarecrow follow one of them) Serpentine. Serpentine!

(The scarecrow continues to follow one of them. Mordecai is running and eventually decides to hide behind a mini tractor. The scarecrow can tell somebody is nearby, but before he can make sure of it, he hears Rigby scream.)

Rigby: (Off-screen) MORDECAI! WHERE ARE YOU?!

(The scarecrow begins to follows the sound. Mordecai tries to escape, but only rams into the scarecrow, who is standing right behind him. The scarecrow snarls as Mordecai screams. Mordecai is about to get away, but the scarecrow grabs his ankle and turns him into a pumpkin.)

Mordecai: Not the face!

Scarecrow: I hope you like, SQUASH! (He stomps on pumpkin Mordecai, squashing him. He then collects the seeds.)

(Meanwhile, Rigby runs into a barn and slides the door close)

Rigby: There's no way he can get me in here!

(Right after he says this, the scarecrow punches a hole through the door)

Scarecrow: Gotcha!

(Rigby climbs up a ladder and runs for an open window. The scarecrow tries to catch him, but fails. Rigby looks down and sees that he is very high up. The scarecrow continues to crawl after Rigby.)

Rigby: Remember to roll.

(He jumps out of the window, but the scarecrow manages to grab his tail. Rigby is then turned into a pumpkin.)

Scarecrow: Got a ripe one here! Just in time for, FALL!

(He drops pumpkin Rigby, causing him to splatter on the ground below. The scarecrow collects the seeds.)

(Muscle Man is shown runing into some reeds, but he trips on a branch. The reeds are still rustling, causing Muscle Man to get up and run away. He's in a circle in the middle of the cornfield, and he squeals as the reeds continue to rustle.)

Muscle Man: Show yourself! (He hears the scarecrow laugh when the reeds started rustling again. He repeatedly punches the air in front of him, as if the scarecrow was there. He then bumps into the scarecrow.) Please, bro, let me go. I didn't know that sign was serious.

Scarecrow: Of course it was! She was my soul mate.

Muscle Man: You'll find someone else.

Scarecrow: You think it's that easy to meet someone else!? Don't get me started on dating! (He grabs Muscle Man and turns him into a solid pumpkin as he laughs) Now, it's time to join your pump kin! (short pause) Wait, does that even make sense? (He snarls and throws Muscle Man onto the ground, squashing him. He then bends down to collect the seeds. He walks away with the seeds, eventually tossing them all up in the air and into the ground.) That'll teach 'em. (He chuckles evilly as he returns to his pole)

(The scene fades to the next day, where a pumpkin patch ceremony is happening)

Child: (Sees the scarecrow) That's a weird-looking scarecrow.

Woman: Yeah.

Kid: Mommy, Mommy, I want one of these!

Kid's mom: Ohhhhhh.....

Pumpkin Muscle Mans: Kid, you don't want one of us. There's some choice ones over there.

Pumpkin Rigbys: Um, I'm not ripe!

Pumpkin Hi-Five Ghosts: Uhhhhh, me neither!

(The pumpkin gang argues as the scarecrow laughs evilly in the background before winking. End of "Jacked-Up Jack-o-Lantern")

Muscle Man: WHOOOOOOOOOO!!!!! Now that was a story, ladies!

Rigby: Boring!

(The guys disagree on Muscle Man's story)

Muscle Man: You guys just don't get to twist ending. It's supposed to be ironic.

Rigby: You're lucky Thomas's story was such a pile, or you'd be stuck in that costume for weeks.

Skips: What are you supposed to be, anyway?

Muscle Man: Peanut butter on bread, bro. I even used the real deal. (He scoops a little peanut butter off his belly) Anybody hungry?

Mordecai: Aww, sick!

Rigby: That's the Thomas's story of costumes.

Muscle Man: Shut it! You haven't seen the whole thing. Hey, Starla!

(Her head comes out of a bucket of water intended for apple bobbing. She then walks over to him.)

Starla: Hi, Mitch.

Muscle Man: Do you prefer creamy or chunky? (He places a giant lunch bag over top of them and they kiss, causing peanut butter and jelly to leak out of the bag)

Rigby: Anybody else have a story?

Benson: (Sighs) What a night, at least I made it to the...huh? Aw, what, I missed the party?

Muscle Man: Not technically. The party is only over when Scottie leaves, isn't that right Scottie?!

Scottie: (Eating a bowl of chips) Yeah, man.

Benson: Ugh! Unbelievable! This is what I get for doing your chores.

Rigby: Dude, is that candy?

Benson: Confiscated candy I got from a couple of park hooligans, no thanks to you. What are you guys even doing, anyway?

Pops: We're playing a scary story game. Whoever tells the best scary story wins everyone's Halloween candy.

Muscle Man: And who ever tells the lamest story has to wear their costume until Thanksgiving dinner. Thomas! (He pretends to cough)

Thomas: You got a cold, Muscle Man?

Mordecai: So how about it, Benson, are you in?

Rigby: Yeah, you got anything better than that costume?

(Benson gives them a glare and throws the candy bag on the table)

Benson: It all took place during a morning meeting, just like any other morning meeting.

Benson: Well, I guess that just about does it. Hanging the Halloween signs, the pumpkins... oh yeah, there is one more thing. We should all get out of here, because there's gonna be a 200 year old poltergeist in the house tonight.

Mordecai: Poltergeist? Are you serious?

Rigby: That sounds awesome!

Benson: No, not awesome. Remember all those things people were saying back in the 1980s? (He counts some off on his fingers) Like bogus, righteous, and wigging out? Well, there was actually a guy saying them 200 years ago, (A flashback sequence begins) and his name was Jebediah Townhouse. He was the previous owner of the house, and everything he ever said or did was two-hundred years ahead of its time.

Jebediah Townhouse: Yo, yo what up, what up what's popping unlocking homies.

(Everyone looks at each other as Jebediah Townhouse begins to dance)

Bensons: Because he was so ahead of its time the town folks knew it could only mean one thing.

Man #1: Witch!

(The mob begins to surround Jebediah Townhouse as he continues to dance when an 80s instrumental piece sounding like MC Hammer's U Can't Touch This plays. Later he goes all the way on top of the house as the clouds begin to turn dark grayish black)

Jebediah Townhouse: Can't touch me up here suckers!

Man #2: Get down Jebediah so we can kill you, you witch!

Man #1: Come now no need for harsh words. Brother Townhouse, please come down here so that we may kill you.

Jebediah Townhouse: I'll show all Y'all. I'm gonna come back in two-hundred years and everybody is going to be talking like me, I'll be the king of the world. (Jebediah Townhouse begins to spin on the top of the center of the house. As he stops lightning appears in front of him) Boom!

Man #1: But we'll all be long gone in two-hundred years!

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh, uh? Well, I'll just kill whoever is in my house then. Boom! (His body turns dark red and melts in the house)

Benson: He fused his soul into the house. Silently waiting for two-hundred to return.

(The thunderclaps in the house as the image of Jebediah Townhouse's face appears and he laughs evilly as the flashback ends)

Benson: Tonight's the night he comes back. So, we should all get out of here before it gets dark. maybe if Jebediah Townhouse doesn't see anybody, he'll go away.

Muscle Man: Pfft lame.

Rigby: (Giggles) If you wanted the house to yourself you can just ask.

Mordecai: Yeah Benson that story doesn't make any sense.

Benson: Well sense or no sense he's coming. There are plenty of documents down of hall of records that back this up. (He packs his suit case and puts it inside his car)

Mordecai & Rigby: Benson's superstitious, Benson's superstitious. He's oh-so very scared, he's shaking in his britches.

Benson: Yes, very scared. (closes the door and puts his sunglasses on) That's why I'm leaving and so should you. Trust me, it's your only chance for survival. (He turns on the car and leaves)

Muscle Man: Dudes, dudes, I just got an idea. We should all come back tonight and see who can stay in the house the longest.

Rigby: Oh yeah now we're talking.

Mordecai: We should make it a little more interesting.

Muscle Man: How so?

Mordecai: We should all put in twenty bucks and then whoever stays the longest can keep all the money.

Rigby: Wait, wait that's like. (He counts the guys) a hundred bucks.

Mordecai: Yeaa-uhh.

Rigby: Alright let's do it.

(The scene cuts to see lightning in dark skies. We get to see Pops' room. Pops is in his bed having trouble sleeping as he goes to sleep. Suddenly he hears his record turning on as he cover his ears. Suddenly the record scratches as it stops. Pops gets out of his bed, turns off the record and goes back to sleep. Suddenly he hears a voice)

Jebediah Townhouse: Pops. (Jebediah Townhouse is seen in the record as he turns around and looks at Pops) What up, Pops!

(Pops screams in terror. We cut to see Mordecai and Rigby playing video games)

Rigby: Where you at, where you at?

(They hear Pops screaming in terror running downstairs)

Mordecai: Dude, Pops, what's wrong?

Pops: J.. Jebediah Townhouse. He spoke to me in my phonograph.

Mordecai: Dude, Pops, Jebediah Townhouse isn't real.

Rigby: Yeah. If your trying to scare us to get the hundred bucks, it's not gonna work.

Pops: But I don't want the hundred dollars, (He takes out his wallet with a few Butterscotch Ripples) I'm already rich.

(Suddenly the TV turns off and lights turn off as well)

Rigby: Aw, come on, we're about to put the hurt on that fool.

Mordecai: Alright, everyone stay cool.

(Mordecai opens the desk, picks up the flashlight and turns it on. Suddenly they heard a strange noise)

Rigby: What's that noise?

(They walk outside of the hallway, the light shows the door and the strange noise is heard again)

Pops: It's him, it's Jebediah Townhouse!

Rigby: Oh no, dude, you might be right Pops, he's come to get you!

(Pops screams in terror. Rigby starts laughing and gets punched by Mordecai)

Mordecai: Knock it off, dude. It's probably nothing. (The door suddenly begins to knock) Rigby, go open the door.

Rigby: No, you go, I don't want whatever is out there killing me so I don't get my hundred bucks.

Mordecai: Alright, we'll all go.

(Mordecai picks up a golf club, Rigby brings another golf club when he opens it in the bag. They walk toward the door, Mordecai gulps and looks outside of the window. Suddenly a figure looking like Jebediah Townhouse pops out of the window. Mordecai screams, the figure opens the door. The three guys scream in terror. Mordecai and Rigby start beating the figure with their golf clubs. The figure is revealed to be Muscle Man in disguise with a garbage pail on his head and High Five Ghost was in the garbage pail)

Muscle Man: What's your deal, bros?!

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man, you scared us to death!

Rigby: What's your problem?!

Muscle Man: Just having a little fun, bro. You don't think I was gonna come over and not try to scare you. Pfft, that hundred bucks is as good as mine.

Rigby: Dude, what were you wearing on your head?

Muscle Man: Fives doesn't have a rain coat, so I'm covering him from this storm with this garbage pail. Geez you don't have to go crazy on me with the golf clubs. Now let's see who can stay in the house the longest.

Mordecai: Ugh, fine.

(We cut the scene to see the storm outside of the window blowing the curtains, with the guys playing the board game Muscle Man was wrapped up with that blanket as High Five Ghost hits the clock line swirling it and stops to 8 as he moves the board game character)

Muscle Man: Nice. You're probably gonna win. Your turn Pops.

(Pops hits the clock line swirling and stops to 9 as Pops gets happy. Suddenly the line starts to swirl by itself and hits to 6. The camera shows Jebediah Townhouse climbing on the escalator and looks at Pops and he screams in horror)

Pops: It's him. (Points at the board game) It's Jebediah Townhouse!

Mordecai: Where? I don't see anything.

Rigby: Yeah, you're freaking me out, Pops.

Muscle Man: Ugh! I can't take this. All this scary stuff is making me hungry. Come on, Fives.

(He removes the blanket and the two walk away to the kitchen with Muscle Man holding the burning candle)

Muscle Man: I wonder if they have anymore of those frozen burritos.

High Five Ghost: Yeah, that'l be awesome.

Muscle Man: Bean and cheese, beef and bean, green chili.

(Muscle Man opens on top of the refrigerator revealed to be the face of Jebediah Townhouse)

Jebediah Townhouse: Yo yo! Ice to meet you fool!

(Muscle Man gasps as Jebediah Townhouse stretches the refrigerator as he's about to eat them but the two run away)

Muscle Man: What the?

(Jebediah Townhouse laughs in the oven)

Jebediah Townhouse: What's cooking Home Skillet.

Muscle Man: Home Skillet? Nobody ever says that anymore. You're a couple decades too late with that bro.

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh yeah? Well, why you on the hot grill?

(Fire comes out of him as Muscle Man and High Five Ghost scream in horror as the other guys on the coffee table playing board games hear them)

Rigby: Ugh! He's probably eaten our food.

Mordecai: He's probably just trying to scare us. You better not be eating all our burritos, dude. (Mordecai opens the door holding another burning candle and walks in the kitchen to search for Muscle Man & HFG) Muscle Man? Fives? (He looks at the oven and Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are revealed to be turned into brownies. Mordecai yells and runs back to Rigby and Pops) We gotta get out of here. It's real. Muscle Man and High Fives both have been turned into brownies!

Pops: Aaah, I knew it. We're done for!

Rigby: Whoa, Whoa wait just hang on a second. If Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are both brownies, then technically we get more money, right?

Mordecai: Yeah you're right. We should just try to stick this out.

(Rigby hums. Suddenly Jebediah Townhouse pops out of the board game)

Jebediah Townhouse: Yeah!, stick it out to the Max!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops scream)

Mordecai: Wait, the Max? What?

Rigby: Hey, nobody talks like that anymore man.

Jebediah Townhouse: What? Nah, you guys are bugging.

Mordecai: What is this guy even...

Jebediah Townhouse: When you wigging out, you know? I mean, you guys are totally bogus.

Rigby: (Points at Jebediah Townhouse) No we don't know, 'cause no one talks like that anymore bro.

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh yeah? Well, GET OUT OF MY HOUSE!

Mordecai: RUN!

(The guys run for their lives as Jebediah Townhouse chases after them but suddenly gets stuck by the empty door beam)

Jebediah Townhouse: Hey, yo get back here fools! I know where you live!

Mordecai: Aaah! We gotta get out of here!

(Jebediah Townhouse's head pops out of the door)

Jebediah Townhouse: Jebediah is in the house!

(The guys scream in terror as they run upstairs but suddenly it turn into gums with teeth on top and a tongue. Pops beings to slip, Mordecai and Rigby hold on to the stair banister as Pops slides down to Jebediah Townhouse. He goes inside his mouth and and gets eaten by him)

Jebediah Townhouse: Aw Yeah, I gotta have my Pops.

(Mordecai and Rigby yell in horror)

Jebediah Townhouse: Time for some dessert.

Rigby: Come on dude let's go!

(They run up to the top of the hallway. Jebediah's head pops out of a window with heads as his eyes and mouth)

Jebediah Townhouse #1: Hey, you dummies don't have a hall pass!

Jebediah Townhouse #2: Yeah, you gotta have a hall pass, dummies!

(They all laugh as they charge towards Mordecai and Rigby as they scream in terror running towards the window)

Mordecai: Dude, the window! (He tries to open it but it doesn't open) It's stuck!

(Rigby beings to scare at Jebediah Townhouse is still laughing coming straight toward them)

Rigby: Wha.. What are we going to do?!

(Jebediah Townhouse still laughing charging toward them)

Mordecai: The attic! (Mordecai opens the attic with ladders come out of the attic)

Rigby: Hurry! (They climb fast as Rigby lost balance and falls down) MORDECAI! (Mordecai grabs Rigby on the leg) Pull me up, quick!

(Jebediah Townhouse continues laughing and charging Mordecai lifts Rigby right on time as Jebediah Townhouse crash in explosion blowing Mordecai and Rigby away)

Mordecai: Who are we kidding we shouldn't never done this.

Rigby: Yeah, I don't even know if I don't want a hundred bucks anymore.

(Jebediah Townhouse laughs as the beams on top of the attic turn into Jebediah Townhouse's arms and hands three Jebediahs come out of the knuckles)

Jebediah Townhouse #1: A hundred bucks? That's major moola.

Jebediah Townhouse #2: Since you don't want it.

Jebediah Townhouse #3: Can I just have it?

(Mordecai and Rigby scream in horror as they run towards the window)

Mordecai: Quick, up to the roof!

(As three Jebediah Townhouse laughs they made it outside of the window as an arm crashes outside of the window the climb on top the roof)

Mordecai: I think we're safe up here.

(Jebediah Townhouse's head pops out of the roof)

Jebediah Townhouse: Raise the roof, Y'all. (Mordecai and Rigby shock in terror as he shaking his head the left and right the two hold on his hair) Where my home boys at? Where my home boys at? There they at, There they at.

Rigby: Make it stop!

Mordecai: Dude, I can't take this guy anymore, forget the hundred bucks let's get out of here.

Rigby: Dude, no, it's to far to jump down!

Jebediah Townhouse: Hey my hair is totally tubular, get it, tubular!

Mordecai: Ugh, I'm going for it! (Mordecai jumps and yells)

Rigby: Mordecai! (Rigby jumps and joins Mordecai)

Jebediah Townhouse: Huh?

Mordecai: Eat on that Jebediah Townhouse!

Mordecai & Rigby: Oooooooooohhhhhh!

(Jebediah Townhouse's hands caught them)

Jebediah Townhouse: Oh, there it is!

(Jebediah Townhouse puts Mordecai & Rigby inside his mouth and eats them and burps but Benson burps. End of "The Previous Owner")

Benson: Excuse me, anyway that's my story.

(The guys love the story)

Mordecai: Dude, Benson, that was awesome.

Pops: I agree good show, a story like that deserves all the candy.

Muscle Man: Hear that Thomas looks like your stuck in your lame costume till Thanksgiving.

Thomas: Aw man.

Benson: Gee, guys, thanks! I'm glad you like it, because it's all true.

Rigby: Huh?

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Benson: Yep, it's all true (Flashback starts with mob holding torches and hay rake with the storm coming out of the sky and Jebediah Townhouse on top of the rooftop) Jebediah Townhouse actually existed and he actually vows to come back in two hundred years to hunt who ever was in the house, but not before signing deed over to Mr. Mallard.

Jebediah Townhouse: (Holding a deed) Sign this, boy.

(Young Mr Mallard sign his name with his pen)

Jebediah Townhouse: Shazam!

(The lightning hits Jebediah Townhouse and melts in the house)

Rigby: Come on, Benson are you being serious?

Benson: Yes, totally serious.

Mordecai: I don't know, guys, I think he's just messing with us.

Pops: (Talking in the phone) Hmm, yes hmm I see, yes goodbye. (He puts the phone back) Oh that was Papa, there is a Jebediah Townhouse.

(The guys gasp in horror)

Mordecai: Well, when is he suppose to show up?

Skips: Yeah, shouldn't we get out of here or something?

Benson: (Checked his watch) Hmm looks like my watch is a little fast, he shouldn't been here five minutes ago.

Scottie: You should really get your watch fixed, man.

(Scottie eats chips then suddenly Jebediah Townhouse pops out of the table and ate Scottie)

Jebediah Townhouse: Hmm hmm, I didn't just crash your party, did I?

(Jebediah Townhouse's hands comes out of the ceiling the guys scream. Outside of the house Jebediah Townhouse's head pops out of the roof the house on the left turns into his arm then the garage door turns into his foot and lift the house)

Jebediah Townhouse: Jebediah Townhouse bet you with the wrong house. (Kicks his right leg) Yeah, boy, that's what I'm talking about (Laughs) Happy Halloween, homies!

Muscle Man: I told you to jump over the fire pit Thomas, not fall into it.

Pops: (Off-screen) Happy Park-iversarry!

(He runs into the living room with gifts, laughing)

Thomas: (Looking at Mordecai and Rigby)  What's a Park-iversarry?

Rigby: Dude, "Park-Anniversary". Just break it down.

Mordecai: (Whispering to Thomas) Pops is gonna give out really lame gifts, but just pretend like you like it or you'll hurt his feelings.

(To Pops)

Mordecai: (continued) Hey, Pops! Happy Park-iversarry!

Pops: I come bearing gifts! I've picked out just the right presents for all of you.

(Pops gives presents to Muscle Man, HFG, and Thomas)

Pops (continued): Oh, I can't wait! (Waving his arms) Open them! Open them!

Muscle Man: (Pulls out a can) Oh ho! Gag Peanut Brittle where a snake pops out!

(He opens the can of peanut brittle with his eyes closed, but nothing comes out)

Muscle Man (continued): ...Or regular peanut brittle. Thanks, Pops.

Hi-Five Ghost: (He goes through his bag to find green socks with red toe tips, a smiley face, and text saying "Be Smiley") Wow! Novelty socks.

Thomas: (He pulls out a mermaid figurine) A mermaid statues made of shells? Man, this is...super neat! Thanks, Pops!

Pops: When in doubt, buy shells. (Ducks down) Now for Mordecai and Rigby's gifts.

(He lifts up two gift bags)

Pops (continued): I think you're really going to like these.

(Mordecai and Rigby grab their gifts)

(Rigby begins ripping the wrapping paper. He sees a box with the text "TANTS CO." in red and sees a man eating a turkey with tants on. He begins reading the text on the box.) 

Rigby: ''Tants. Dare to dine anywhere with flare in Tants!" "The pants that are also a table!"

Mordecai: Uh, they're great, Pops.

Rigby: Yeah, thanks, Pops

Pops: (laughing) Wonderful! I knew they'd be a hit. Well, I still have gifts for Skips and Benson. Happy Park-iversarry

(Everyone says bye to Pops as he exits the room).

Mordecai: What are gonna do with 'tants'?

Muscle Man: I think you hit the jackpot this year. Those tants are pretty fresh (pulls the 'nice' gesture) You know, I could take those tants off your hands for ya. Free of charge.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmmm

(Mordecai agrees 'hm, hm')

Rigby: Yeah, sure. Go for it.

Muscle Man: A wise decision, bro.

(Scene moves to Mordecai playing video games and Rigby spectating. Pops enters the room.)

Pops: Ta-daaa (He is wearing the tants)

Mordecai: Woahhh, what are you wearing?

Pops: (spinning so they can get a glimpse) Tants! I'm wearing tants! You must have not tried them on yet.

Mordecai and Rigby: (both laugh awkwardly) Yeah, you got us.

Pops: You know, I didn't want to make a big deal in front of the others, but I gave extra-heart into picking out your presents.

Rigby: (confused) Really?

Pops: Oh yes! I wanted to use the Park-iversarry as an opportunity to thank you for being such good friends to me.

Pops (Continued): I thought we could all wear our tants and have lunch together!

Mordecai: Uhhh, we...uh...kinda-don't...have the tants...anymore.

(Pops makes a whining sound after hearing the response, crinkling his face so it looks like he's going to cry)

Mordecai (continued): We gave the tants-

(Pops is on the brink of a tantrum)

Mordecai (continued): -Uh-huh, we gave the tants-

(Tears well up in Pops' eyes)

Rigby: We gave them to the dry cleaners!

Mordecai: -uh, yeah-yeah! We took them to the dry cleaners to make sure they would be clean the first time we'd try them on!

(Pops immediately recovers from his to-be tantrum and gasps in relief)

Pops: Good show! Then let's do lunch tomorrow when you pick up your tants.

(M&R agree with replies)

Pops: Splendid! (He laughs as he exits out of the room, hitting the wall due to his tants, but runs through at the end, laughing with joy)

(We hear more noise from M&R's point of view, with Pops having several collisions and laughter fades away)

Rigby: Dude, did you see his face?

Mordecai: Yeah, we can't make Pops cry. Those tants are really bad, but hurting Pops' feelings is worse. Come on, we gotta see Muscle Man about those tants.

(Scene cuts to Muscle Man's house. Mordecai knocks on the door.)

Muscle Man: Yes?

Mordecai: We really need those tants back.

Muscle Man: Yeah, okay. Me and Starla are done with them anyway.

(Scene cuts to the tants. They are ruined.)

Mordecai and Rigby: AH! WHAT THE?!

Rigby: Gross, what did you do?!

Muscle Man: All I did was have a pizza dinner, with Starla.

Mordecai: Ugh! Did you even eat any of it?

Rigby: There's like a whole slice in the pant leg!

Muscle Man: You don't need to get all worked up about it, just wash them, they'll be fine.

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugh!

(Scene cuts to the dry cleaners).

Mordecai: More up!

Rigby: Wait, let me switch my grip.

Mordecai: Alright, now, turn the tants to the right.

(Rigby turns the tants to his angle of right)

Mordecai (annoyed): No, my right!

Rigby: It's not fitting.

Mordecai: Because you need to turn the tants!

Rigby: I am turning it, you just have to push it more!

Mordecai: It's not gonna work like that! The tants won't fit.

Rigby: Why do you keep saying 'tants' so much?

Mordecai: Just turn them.

Rigby: Just shove 'em in!

(He seizes Mordecai's side of the tants and attemps to push them in the washing machine. He gets the large parts to fold on each other and pushes, but the force of his push caused the cardboard to rip. Rigby panics)

Mordecai: Agh! You're breaking them! Take them out!

(Rigby grunts as he and Mordecai attempt to remove the tants from the washing machine. As he lifts a part, Mordecai unwillingly hit the 'start' button with his arm on the machine. The sound of water was heard within the machine)

Rigby: What was that?

(The machine starts rumbling).

Mordecai: Dude, look out!

(He pulls Rigby to his side and they both fall to the ground. The machine starts spinning, as the fatal crunching sounds of the tants is heard. M&R watch in distraught).

Rigby: Maybe we can fix it?

Mordecai: There's nothing left to fix!

(The tants are completely destroyed.)

Mordecai: We gonna have to buy new tants.

(Scene cuts to a computer screen where 'tants' is searched)

Rigby: There it is! Click it, click it!

Mordecai: Alright, Lets see.

Rigby: Which one is it?

Mordecai: Uh, this one!

Rigby: Two hundred dollars?!

Mordecai: The ergonomic cup holder makes it limited edition?

Rigby: Ugh. I can't believe Pops spent so much money on us.

Mordecai: We're not limited edition friends, we're just standard issue jerks. We're gonna have to tell Pops

Pops: (suddenly enters the room) Mordecai! Rigby!

(The duo jump out of their chairs in suprise)

Pops: I've been looking all over for you! I've been so excited about tomorrow!

(Pops starts to laugh in excitement M&R look at reach other. Pops starts to cough due to his laughter. He recovers and takes a breath and wipes his mouth with a hankie)

Pops: Anyway, I forgot to ask which beverage you'd like. Lemonade or Pink Lemonade?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhhh...

Pops: Oh, what am I saying? (flaps his arms in front of him) I'll get both! Let's go wild, it is our first tants lunch together. (Laughs) I "tant" wait for it.

(Pops runs out of the room, laughing in joy as he chants,'Tants lunch! Tants lunch!' constantly till the noise fades away)

Mordecai: We can't tell Pops.

Rigby: Ughh...What're we gonna do?

Mordecai: Just let me think. It's just pants in a table. Maybe we could just make some tants

Rigby: Make 'em? How?

Mordecai: Remember that one time Benson made park uniforms for everyone?

Rigby: Oh, the ones we only wore once?

(Flashback showing M&R wearing golf-like park uniforms, both unhappy, and Benson is smiling at his work)

Mordecai: Yeah, those. Anyway, if we use that sewing machine, we can make new tants.

Rigby: Oh yeah!

Mordecai: Where was that thing again?

Rigby: The basement?

Mordecai: Yeah! The basement!

(Scene cuts to M&R standing and staring towards a sewing machine in the basement).

Mordecai: Dude, I don't know how to use this thing.

Rigby: Well neither do I!

Mordecai: What are we gonna do?

(M&R gasp and snap their finger, for an idea came to mind)

Mordecai & Rigby: Eileen!

Eileen: Wow! A diamond crown Stitch Horse 5000 double-diamond series?! You know they stop making these in '75. It's the last of its series to have a solid steel throat-plate.

Rigby: So does that mean you can do it?

Eileen: With a workhorse like this (pats the machine) I think I can manage. But if we're gonna get these tants done by tomorrow, you guys will need to help.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm hm!

(Montage begins of Mordecai, Rigby and Eileen creating the tants. After some research, mistakes and construction, the trio slide the cardboard into the 2 tants).

Rigby: Whoa, Eileen, they look great!

Eileen: They really do, don't they?

Mordecai: Awesome! Now we just have to add the logos and make them look legit.

(Mordecai comes back with a trash bag and opens it, revealing the damaged tants. One of them has the logo spelling 'Tants Co').

Eileen: Are you sure about ripping off the logo? The warning seems pretty specific

(Inside the tants, a label says 'Warning: Tampering or removal of Tants co. logo is punishable by TantsCo law').


Mordecai: But if we don't use the real logo, Pops would know they're different tants. We have to take it. For Pops' lunch.

(Mordecai tears of the logo, revealing a red button that starts beeping ominously and emitting noise.)

Mordecai: Huh?!

(The button then flashes subsequently. The trio yelp and run as a laser comes shooting out of the button. The laser then draws a door shape in front of the trio, which becomes a portal. Two arms come out, a leg, and then a man's face. He comes out of the portal followed by 4 tant-wearing men in soldier uniform. The man in the black suit, who was unusually tall, stood in the middle of the pack).

Tants Co. President: Cease and desist!

Mordecai: Who are you?!

Tants Co. President: Hm, only the active president and founder of Tants Co., maker of tants! I'm here to investigate a grave violation of Tants Co. company rules: Tampering or removal of the official Tants Co. logo is forbidden by law - of my company, and is punishable - by my company.

Tants Soldier #1: Uh sir, you better take a look at this.

(Two of the Tants soldiers pull the prepared tants towards the Tants Co. President, who takes a deep breath)

Tants Co. President: Do you know how many Tants Co. laws you're violating with these off-brand tants?!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Eileen murmur unknowingly)

Rigby: A couple?

Tants Co. President: Well, its at least seventeen-easily! The Tants Co. company makes subsequent products on my families bread and butter. Heck, those products are family to me! It's like you're walking into my home and taking the food right out of my wife's mouth! Well, I can't let this continue. Today, it's Bootleg Tants, but will it be tomorrow! Bootleg Glups?!

(The trio, aside from Rigby, look at each other)

Tants Co. President: Ugh...you know, the gloves that are also a coffee cup?

(A Tants soldier is seen wearing Glups on both hands)

Tants Co. President: Or, maybe you wanna make Sombrasses, the sombrero that's also glasses?

Eileen: Ugh!

Tants Co. President: And what about Shtilts? The shoes that are also stilts! Are you gonna bootleg these?

(He pulls down his long trousers, to which M&R prefer not to look at)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa, whoa!

Eileen: It's okay. He still got pants on.

(M&R sigh in relief. The camera tilts from the bottom to the top of the shtilts, up to the President, who is much smaller than expected)

Tants Co. President: If these fraud tants exist, it will open a floodgates to all kinds of bootleg Tants Co. products! But I'm not about to let that happen to my company! I'm destroying these imposters.

(The President advances towards the unofficial tants. M&R and Eileen make a dash to stop him, protesting)

Mordecai, Rigby and Eileen: NO! STOP! YOU CAN'T!

(The Tants soldiers come to stop them from advancing. Mordecai faces the 'glups'- wearing soldier, who Mordecai can't attack due to the mugs and almost has coffee spilt on him).

Rigby (punching): IN YOUR FACE!

(It shows Rigby trying to punch a soldier but due to his size he can only reach the waist he's not even hitting).

(Eileen is seen trying to overwhelm the soldier with sombrasses but no luck, whilst grunting).

(The trio are overwhelmed and are pushed back by the tants soldiers who surround them as the Tants Co. President laughs modestly).

Tants Co. President: You know, brand-made Tants Co. Tants are fireproof Did you make yours fireproof?

(He takes the Tants to a furnace)

Mordecai: Don't do it!

Eileen: No!!

Tants Co. President: Hmph. Before I torch these imposters, just tell me one thing. Why on this good green Earth, would you make fake tants?

Mordecai: Because we had to!

Tants Co. President: Ha! Liar, liar, tants on fire! There is no good reason to bootleg tants!

Mordecai: Pops! Pops is a good reason. He bought us real tants from your company. He just wanted to have one lunch with us in tants, but we didn't appreciate Pops or his gifts, and they got ruined. We were just trying to fix things.

Rigby: And Eileen worked really hard to help us!

Mordecai: I'm sorry we ripped the label off. And I'm sorry we made fake tants. But we couldn't let Pops down and still call ourselves his friends.

(Mordecai and Rigby look down in guilt)

Pops (o/s): But that is the reason I consider you my best friends.

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops!

(Pops is seen at the front of the basement steps)

Pops: I heard everything.

Rigby: Pops! We're so sorry!

Pops: No! I won't hear it. The lengths that you went for my sake mean more than any lunch in tants! That is true friendship.

Mordecai: Thanks, Pops.

(The Tants Co. President is crying. He dries his tears with an oddly-looking tie with and end shaped like a hankie).

Tants Co. President: (Sad voice) Tiekercheif. The tie that's also a handkerchief. (The President tucks it in his shirt) I've never seen such a touching display of friendship in all my life. This is why I started TantsCo...for the people. It's more beautiful than any product my company can make!

Rigby: Does this mean we can have our tants back?

Tants co. President: NO!

(He suddenly pushes the tants right inside the furnace incinerating them)

Mordecai, Rigby and Eileen: NO!

Eileen: MY WORK!

Tants co. President: Hahaha! Real friends deserve real tants! Tants all around!

Mordecai: Nice!

Rigby: Aw, Sweet!

Eileen: I don't even know what's real and what's not...

(Scene cuts to the afternoon. Mordecai, Rigby and Pops are wearing tants, all wielding a dish on their table. Pops is holding lemonade, and Mordecai and Rigby are holding glasses filled with it)

Mordecai: You know Pops, these tants are pretty choice.

Pops: Yes, isn't the fabric nice and breathable?

Rigby (chewing): Yeah, totally!

(Muscle Man and Starla appear holding each other and have their legs in a four legged trouser fuse).

Muscle Man: Check it out! The Tants Co. President gave us this prototype frelt!

Starla: It even came with these four-legged acid wash jeans!

(Mordecai and Rigby and Pops look astonished).

Muscle Man: It's okay if you're jealous. Tants are pretty last season.

(The couple take off, with their arms in each other's back trouser pocket).

Mordecai: Pops, I know we're friends, but please don't ever buy us frelts.

Pops: Oh. I'd never do that! Those look ridiculous!

Rigby: Oh, the pressure is on! Will Skips sink a triple bank to top the shot or will Rigby remain undefeated?

(Skips shoots and he misses)

Skips: Aw, nuts.

Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, and Mordecai: OOOHHHH!

Rigby: (Grabs the basketball) All Rigby needs is one simple bank shot and this deal is done dotta. (He prepares to shot) What's his gut tell him? (Goes to his stomach and back up to his face) Says it's gonna be a good one.

(Rigby shoots and succeeds again)

Rigby: Aw yeah! Year of the Rigbyyyyyyy! (Rotates his hat on his head) Who else wants to play against the masta?

Muscle Man: No way, bro. I'd rather play a game I might actually win.

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. How are you so good at this game?

Rigby: You guys are just overthinking it. Now, who wants to step it to the king?

Cash Bankis: I do.

(Steps out of his booth)

Two Guys: Cash Bankis!

(Cash walks over to the guys)

Rigby: Uh, what was that? You said you want to bank some shots?

Cash Bankis: You talk a lot of talk kid. You wanna prove you're the man? Then how about a little wager?

Rigby: What do you want to bet?

Cash Bankis: Loser pays for the winner's bill.

Mordecai: Rigby, wait. This guy's weird. I don't trust him.

Rigby: Don't trust him? His name's Cash; he can afford to pay our meal.

Mordecai: That's not why I don't trust-

Rigby: I accept.

(Cash removes his hood, revealing him having a basketball hoop for a head. The guys gasp)

Cash Bankis: Tank, ball bag me.

(Tank gives Cash a bag and removes a basketball with the word "Bankis" made of crystals on it)

Rigby: I'll let you go first, 'cause no matter what you do, it's gonna be easy for me to top-

(Cash shoots and succeds; the guys gasp)

Rigby: -it. Pfft. That shot was alright, but this shot's even better!

(Rigby shoots and misses)

Rigby: What? My gut never lets me down.

(Cash shoots and succeeds again)

Cash Bankis: The bill.

(Gives the bill to Rigby)

Rigby: $12,000?! What have you been eating?

Cash Bankis: Me and the boys been eating gold-plated chicken all night.

(Goes to the booth with the others eating gold chicken)

Guy: This gold really holds in the moisture.

Rigby: Double or nothing!

Mordecai: Rigby, don't!

Rigby: I bet double or nothing that I can bank it off the far wall and into the hoop.

Cash Bankis: Throw in that hat as a side bet and you got a deal.

Rigby: What? But I almost died for this hat!

Cash Bankis: It's the one thing money can't buy, and it's the only deal I'll take.

Mordecai: Dude, don't do it. You can't make a shot off the wall!

Rigby: Yes I can; I can feel it in my gut. I've never felt so sure of any bank shot in my entire life!

(Rigby prepares to shot)

Rigby: Talk to me, gut.

(Rigby makes sure his shot will work)

Rigby: Hmm. Greatest bank shot of all time!

(Rigby throws the ball and it goes through the window and makes a car crash)

Rigby: But it should've worked.

Cash Bankis: (Takes Rigby's hat and puts it on his head) I'll take that. Perfect fit, now pay up loser.

Rigby: I don't have that kind of money!

Cash Bankis: Then you shouldn't made that kind of bet. If you don't have it, maybe your pals here do.

(Mordecai, Skips, Muscle Man, and Hi Five Ghost all murmur nervously and back up into Cash's friends)

Rigby: Wait, wait. I want another rematch. Triple or nothing.

Cash Bankis: Triple or nothing huh? I accept.

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing?! We don't have 36 grand!

Rigby: I don't care how much it is, 'cause I'm not gonna lose! Let's go!

Cash Bankis: You are on.

Mordecai: Hold on; give us a couple a days. Rigby needs to brush up on his skills. (Gets in Rigby's face) Don't you, Rigby?

Cash Bankis: Fine, fine. You got till tomorrow. (Spins the basketball on his finger) But if you lose, we get the money, (Catches ball) and none of you can ever show your faces in Wing Kingdom ever again.

(Muscle Man squeal-screams)

Cash Bankis: See ya tomorrow, friend.

(Cash Bankis and his friends laugh and walk away)

Mordecai: Way to rope us into your mess.

Skips: I don't know you.

Muscle Man: If my future at Wing Kingdom is at stake because of you, that 36 thousand dollars will be the LEAST of your problems.

Rigby: I gotta win this game.

(Scene goes to Rigby finishing the basketball hoop)

Rigby: That should do it. (gets ready to practice) Man, I can't believe my gut was wrong. Maybe it's time to rely on my brain instead. (throws ball but it misses) Alright, no more fooling around! (throws ball again, and it misses again) Ah, what?! (grabs ball and throws it furiously, making it crash everywhere and into Benson's office window)

Benson: (from inside) Oh, come on! Are you kidding me?!

Rigby: (sighs) I need help. (scene cuts to hallway. Rigby is looking at a picture of his friends.) I really messed this up for everyone. (we see Rigby's friends standing there. They all give him a glare and walk away. Rigby sighs) Guess there's only one person who can help me now..(calls a number) Hey, can you come over? I need your help.

(Scene cuts to Rigby sitting on the stairs waiting for someone. A familiar looking car pull up to the house Don comes out)

Don: Rigbone! How's my big bro?

Rigby: Thanks for coming, Don.

Don: Man, it's been a while. You look good. Gotta say I'm a little surprised you called me. What's up?

Rigby: I'm in a lotta trouble, Don. There's these guys--

Don: Oh, hey! Bank shot! (walk up to it) I haven't seen one of these since we were kids. (performs a perfect bank shot) Whoo! Good times. So, uh, what's the problem?

Rigby: I ran my mouth off to the wrong guys and now I'm in trouble. I gotta win a bank shot match. All my money's ridin' on it.

Don: But you're great at this.

Rigby: Not anymore! I lost my touch. You're the only guy I know who's better at this than me. You gotta help me out.

Don: Well, here. (passes the ball to Rigby) Show me what you got.

(Rigby shoot the ball, but it hits the hoop, bounces off Rigby's head, and goes through Benson's office window, which was supported with cardboard)

Benson: Oh, not again!

Don: I see, we've got a lot of work to do.

Rigby: Well, let's get started

Don: Wait. Lemme get my workout gear on. (puts on a headband) Alright, let's go!

(We are shown an montage of Rigby and Don practising bank shots.)

Rigby: How do you do it, man? You never miss!

Don: You're just overthinking it. I've seen you do bank shots I can't believe. You're just as good as me. Maybe even better. You've always trusted your gut ever since we were kids. Why stop now?

Rigby: I did trust my gut on that epic shot and I lost my trucker hat. My gut doesn't know anything. I can't rely on feelings. If I lose that rematch I'll let all my friends down.

Don: You won't lose, Rigby. I believe in you.

Rigby: Really?

Don: I know it right here.

Rigby: Thanks, man. (Goes to try again) Time to show that square-faced sucka who's boss! Wah-pow! (does an amazing bank shot into the hoop. Rigby's friends walk over to him, impressed.)

Hi Five Ghost: Woah!

Muscle Man: Yo, Rigby! That was a smooth move, bro!

Rigby: Yeah-yuh! Don helped me get back in the game! (Everyone greets Don)

Don: Hey, guys!

Rigby: Yeah! I'm gonna crush him!

Muscle Man: We're behind you all the way bro, win or lose.

Skips: But, you know, we'd prefer you win.

Rigby: Thanks, guys. I know I can do it.

Mordecai: Then let's get to that rematch so you can ice that fool.

(Cut to Rigby, Don and the guys heading back to Wing Kingdom. Cash and his friends are waiting for them.)

Cash Bankis: So you decided to show up. Good. I'm looking forward to that extra change. It's $36,000, right, Clarence? (Clarence shoots him a cool look)

Rigby: (grabs a banking ball) You can go first.

Cash Bankis: Great. Let's get this over with, 'cause I'm (shoots) hungry! (makes a shot, then chuckles) Looks like I'll be upgrading to (spins ball) diamond chicken.

(Rigby gets ready to make his shot. He fumbles a bit, but catches his ball. The guys chatter. Cash puts on Rigby's eggscellent hat.)

Rigby: No, I'm eggscellent! Huh! (He shoots and makes a shot.) Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm!

Cash Bankis: Hmm! (bounces the ball with his elbows and makes a shot.)

(Rigby kicks up the ball, then shoots it into the hoop off his head. Cash spins the ball and throws it off with a finger. The ball banks off four chairs and into the hoop. Rigby throws up the ball, catches it, and pounds it off the ground, sending it through the soft drink area where it gets covered with drink, and into the hoop again. Cash shoots; it bounces off a backboard and into the hoop. Rigby shoots, same result. Cash shoots again, same result. Rigby; same result. Cash makes a shot, Rigby makes a shot. Cash is now frustrated. He throws the ball off the wall, and it slides through the deer statues's antlers, off a fan, off the front table, hits a glass cup, and dives through the hoop. Everyone is shocked.)

Cash Bankis: Top that!

(Rigby prepares to make his next shot, with a worried look on his face. He throws the ball, and it bounces off the hoop, off the hanging plant, on the pool table, knocks off a trophy, hits a few backboards and back into the hoop. Everyone cheers.)

Rigby: (spins) OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHH!

(Cash winces before making his next shot. The ball bounces off the hoop, off a broken lamp, around a big bowl of a couple's sundae, off a photo of The Wing King, and back to the hoop where it bounces between the two middle backboards. The two bankers are watching. The ball finally bounces off the rim of the hoop. Everyone except Cash cheers.)

Cash Bankis: Nooo!

Mordecai: One more shot and you win, Rigby!

(Rigby looks at Don before making his shot, and Don put his hand to his heart. Rigby smiles and nods with confidence. The audience cheers on for Rigby. Close up to his face, he closes his eyes and makes the shot. The ball bounces off the jukebox, shatters the 'Try Our Special Sauce' sign, goes through the restroom doors, around a toilet seat, back through the doors, off the wall, off the bottom right backboard, off the top left backboard, and finally, into the hoop! Everyone cheers as Rigby's friends run to him.)

Skips: I knew you could do it.

(Rigby, his brother and his friends walk up to Cash.)

Rigby: Looks like you'll be paying your own bill, Cash. Aaaaand, I'll take my hat back, please.

Cash Bankis: Oh, no. Uh-uh. You may not have to pay me that money, but I won this hat fair and square on that side bet! You'll never see it again.

Rigby: Aw, man, he's right. The hat's his.

???: Hold everything!

Rigby: Huh?

(Steam comes out from the bathroom doors, and a familar looking character comes out. Rigby, Don and his friends gasp.)

Mordecai: The God of Basketball?

God of Basketball: Rigby, your original 'Double or nothing' shot is still in play.

Rigby: The one that banked out the window? But how?

God of Basketball: It's my duty to keep track of all things basketball. And when your ball went out the window, it continued to bank!

(Flashback of Rigby's double or nothing shot. When his ball went out the window, it banked out a plant pot, and started banking down the path.)

God of Basketball: Huh? (sees  the banking ball and decidesto follow it)

(The banking ball goes down the path, through wheat fields, through the desert, past a farm with cows, through Peru, onto a plane where it banks in its seat while having coffee, off the plane and into another banking ball. They go banking with each other.The God of Basketball watch them mate and get "married". Rigby's banking ball decide to bank back to Wing Kingdom to win Rigby bet. The flashback ends)

Rigby: Does this mean my gut feeling was right this whole time? Is the shot gonna go in?

God of Basketball: I'm as curious as you. I arrived ahead of time so I could catch the final moment myself.

Mordecai: Wait. What's that sound?

(Banking can be heard in the background. Rigby's double or nothing ball returns through the cardboard window, off four seats, off the soft drink dispenser, off the plant, off the couple's sundae, through the bathroom doors, off a flusher, back through the double doors, sliding through the statue's antlers, off someone's plate of wings, and it bounces off Cash's head, knocking off the Eggscellent hat. After bounces off backboards numerous times, the ball goes round the rim of the hoop, and finally into the hoop! Everyone cheers.)

Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

God of Basketball: (picking up the Eggscellent hat) Rigby, you have truly made (puts the hat on Rigby) the greatest bank shot of all time!

(His friends cheers and pick him up.)

Rigby: Oh yeah! My shots are like the best part of the alphabet! L-M-N-

All: Oooooooo!

Mordecai and Rigby: Ping pong!

(They start playing with Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost)

Hi-Five Ghost: I got it! (He hits it with his paddle)

Muscle Man: Nice!

(Mordecai hits it with his paddle, then Muscle Man hits it with his paddle, then Rigby hits it with his paddle)

Mordecai: Oh, Rigby...

(Muscle Man tries to hit it, but missed it)

Muscle Man: Aw, come on!

Rigby: You gotta go long with the ping pong!

(The guys laugh)

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost: Ping pong! Ping pong! Ping pong! Ping Pong! (They laugh again)

(A muscular man named Dale hears them, drops the weights, wipes his face with a towel, and throws the towel on Muscle Man's face)

Muscle Man: Augh! What's your problem, bro?

Dale: Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: Oh. Hey, Dale.

Mordecai: Muscle Man, you know this guy?

Dale: Yeah, he knows me. We used to be in bodybuilding contests together.

Rigby: Really?

Dale: Yeah, he used to be hot stuff. Now he's just a hot mess! And we don't allow hot messes like you guys to play ping pong in our gym, so get outta here!

Mordecai: It's a free country, man, you can't tell us what to do.

(Dale picks up the Ping pong ball, placed it on his chest, and destroys it with his abs)

Muslce Man: You leave us alone, Dale! (He throws the towel on Dale's face)

Dale: (growls) What? Do you think you're tough now, bro? Look at you. You don't even deserve to be called Muscle Man no more, Mitch. (He closes up to Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Nobody calls me that except for my girlfriend, and also the guy at the airport who checks my driver's license, but that's besides the point, I've got more muscles now than you'll ever have.

Dale: Oh yeah?! Okay, then, the Power Tower Biceptennial is this weekend. (He points at the poster) It's the biggest bodybuilding contest around. If you can beat me, then you and your little ping pong posse can come here and play whenever you want. But until that day, I don't wanna to see any of your faces anywhere near the Power Tower! Do I make myself clear?!

Muscle Man: Oh, you're clear alright. You're clearly gonna lose to me at the Biceptennial, and me and my friends are gonna play ping pong here whenever we want!

(A clock transition changes to the guys at his trailer at the park)

Mordecai: Dude, you don't have to do this, you know.

Rigby: Dude, that guy is super ripped. There's no way you can beat him.

Mordecai: I thought the whole reason you were called Muscle Man was to be ironic, anyways.

Rigby: Yeah, 'cause you're so out of shape, you know.

Muscle Man: Hmm. How's this for out-of-shape?

(He hands Mordecai and Rigby a picture of himself with muscles at the Biceptenial)

Mordecai and Rigby: Wooaahh....

Rigby: Man, you weren't kidding.

Muscle Man: Yeah, bros. Back then, I was the real deal. I was the Muscle Man. (Flashback begins with Muscle Dad placing his camera and posing behind the City Power Tower) I really got into bodybuilding through my dad. (Scene then changes to a young Muscle Man sitting and watching Muscle Dad lifting weights) Everyday I go with him to the Power Tower and watch him lift weights. He may not had the most rip body, but he was as strong as an ox, until one day...

(Muscle Dad's arm bent and the weights lifted down on his chest)

Young Muscle Man: Muscle Dad! (He runs up to him and lifted the weights off him as muscles grew on his body which it ripped his shirt off.) What?

Bodybuilder 1: Huh?

Bodybuilder 2 and 3: Huh?

Bodybuilders: Woah, check it. It's pretty cool, man. Awesome. He's ripped.

(The body builders and Muscle Dad walk right up to Young Muscle Man)

Bodybuilder 2: Hey, kid, what happened?

Young Muscle Man: I don't know. I was just sitting over there, and my dad was lifting over here, and I lifted the weights up off of him. (He starts posing)

Bodybuilder 3: His posing is perfect.

Bodybuilder 1: Your boy's a natural, Muscle Dad.

(The bodybuilders chat, and Muscle Dad smiles at him as Young Muscle Man smiled as well)

Muscle Man: Then I was finally ready to compete in the Power Tower Biceptennial.

(Everyone cheers for him)

Muscle Man: I had it all. Muscles, technique, the total package.

(Everyone cheers again)

Chaz McAllister: The winner, Muscle Man!

(Muscle Dad smiles at him, as Muscle Man posses with his trophy)

Everyone: Muscle Man! Muscle Man! Muscle Man!

(Flashback ends and fades back to Mordecai and Rigby still holding the picture)

Muscle Man: After a while, I kept winning every match and I got bored. So I decided to step away from that whole bodybuilding scene. But now I'm ready to get back into it so I can win the Biceptennial and beat Dale. (He pulls a rope, but the tire swing and the tree fall down.) Let's go back to the Power Tower.

(A clock transition changes back to the City Power Tower. Muscle Man is doing some weights)

Hi-Five Ghost: One more! One more! (Muscle Man lifted the weights on top. Fives clapped) Let's take five.

Rigby: Dude, are you thinking what i'm thinking?

Mordecai: What? Oh, ping pong?

Rigby: Ping pong!

Mordecai: Haha, yeah. Wait, what if Dale's here.

Rigby: It's just one quick game.

Mordecai: Okay, but let's hurry before he sees us.

(He and Rigby go to the ping pong table and start playing. Mordecai tries to hit it to Rigby, but Dale destroys it with his abs again while dust falls on the table)

Dale: Go ahead, keep playing.

Mordecai: Really?

Dale: Yeah, keep playing.

(Mordecai picks up another ball and tries to hit it to Rigby again, but Dale destroys it again with his back abs)

Dale: Keep playing!

Mordecai: But we barely have any...

Dale: Come on!

(Mordecai picks up another ball and tries to hit it to Rigby again, but Dale destroys it again with his legs. Mordecai screams)

Dale: What's up?

Muscle Man: What did I say, Dale, huh?! Leave us alone!

Dale: I told you guys not to come here, Mitch!

Muscle Man: I told you not to call me that!

Dale: (bump chests Muscle Man) You wanna go?!

Muscle Man: (bump chests Dale) Yeah! Let's go right now!

(They took off their shirts and stars flexing, but Fives and the bodybuilders break up the fight)

Hi-Five Ghost: Alright, alright, break it up!

Dale: You don't stand a chance, Mitch!

Muscle Man: Whatever, man, you're so going down! Aaaahhhh! I got to face facts, I'll never be able to get buff in time for the Biceptennial.

(Mordecai, Rigby and Hi-Five Ghost look at each other.)

Muscle Man: There's only one way to beat him....technique.

(Scene cuts back to Muscle Man's trailer in a montage of Muscle Man doing instructions of flexing his muscles in different VHS recordings of the Biceptennial until the montage ends)

Muscle Man: Augh! This is hopeless! I'll never gonna win the Biceptennial! (He flips the table and a box of VHS tapes on the ground until a red VHS tape case fells out of the box) Huh? What's this? (He picks up a VHS tape that saids "For Muscle Son Love, Muscle Dad" opens it picks up a note which Muscle Dad wrote and his thought bubble of Muscle Dad writing the note appears as he reads.)

Muscle Dad: (voice-over) Son, if you're reading this, I've passed away and you're about to enter the Power Tower Biceptennail, which you need to win so you can beat some jerk and let your friends play ping pong. This takes a gains a pose that will guarantee victory, or very painful death. Good luck, son, I believe in you. Love, Muscle Dad.

(His thought bubble disappears, then Mordecai, Rigby and Hi-Five Ghost went into Muscle Man's trailer)

Mordecai: Muscle Man? Hey, Muscle Man, are you ready...?

Muscle Man: Shhh. My ghost dad sent me this ghost tape from beyond the grave. It's gonna help me win the contest.

(The guys watch a clip from the 1976 Power Tower Biceptennial)

Chaz: Up next, in the '76 Power Tower Biceptennial is reigning champion, Don Denunzio!

Muscle Man: Oh, my dad told me about this guy!

Chaz: Denunzio will finish off with the Shredder!

Judge: Remind me again what the Shredder is, Chaz.

Chaz: The Shredder has two meanings. For one, if done correctly, it shreds all of the competition. Two, if you falter in the slightest, it will literally shred all of your muscles, leading of course to an instant angonizing death.

Judge: Talk about a double-edged sword.

Chaz: Oh, he's going behind the head for the hand clasp. I think he's gonna do it! I think he's...

(When Don misses the hands, he explodes and then a colorful Please Stand By sign appeared. Mordecai, Rigby and Hi-Five Ghost, except for Muscle Man are shocked)

Muscle Man: Easy! Don't worry, bros, I totally got this.

Mordecai: What?! Are you crazy?

Rigby: Yeah, man, don't risk your life so we can play ping pong.

Muscle Man: It's about more than just ping pong. It's about sticking up for ourselves. And if I want to win the Biceptennial, then I say it's shredding time!

(Scene cuts to the Power Tower Biceptennial. Fives shaves his hair off, puts on muscle musk, Muscle Man putting on hair gel, and putting on workout underwear)

Muscle Man: Time to win this thing.

(He and Fives go up to the stage while Mordecai and Rigby are sitting on a couch, looking shocked about the Shredder)

Chaz: This is Chaz McAllister, coming to you live from the Power Tower Biceptennial. 

Judge #3: Next up to the stage, we have Dale the Daletard Decico! (Everyone cheers as he comes on stage. He hi fives a bodybuider.) And making his return, we have Muscle Man!

Man: Yeah! I remember when he was a kid, he spotted his dad! (When Muscle Man comes out, he and the guys look unhappy at his appearance.)

Mordecai: (clapping) It's okay, Muscle Man!

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, you got this, bro!

Judge #3: And we'll now be commencing the competition with the first pose: Abdominals and Thighs!

(All the bodybuilders, including Muscle Man, do the pose. The crowd cheers.)

Man: Oh, man! Did you see that technique?

Judge #3: The Crab Most Muscular!

(Muscle Man flexes his breasts as the others do the pose. Everyone, including his friends, cheers. The judges are relally impressed. The bodybuilders continue posing. The fifth bodybuilder gives a double thumbs-up.)

Chaz: Hey, we got a two thumbs-up pose! (The fourth bodybuilder gives a double peace sign.) Ooh, there's a peace sign! (The judges are not pleased.) And it looks like the judges don't seem too convinced by these poses. (We see the bodybuilders giving excellent poses.)

Judge #3: Unbelievable! This is shaping up to be a true clacial styles! (raises hand) The judges have reached a decision. The two contestants moving on to the sudden death round are: Dale the Daletard Decico...

Dale: Yes!

Judge #3: ...and although his body is very very out of shape, we all agree that his technique is immaculate. Muscle Man!

Muscle Man: Yes!

(The crowd cheers, including Muscle Man's friends.)

Dale: Alright, Mitch. Time to show the world who the real Muscle Man is!

Muscle Man: Yeah! They're all gonna see that it's me!

(Dale growls and the two begin posing. Muscle Man soon begins to tire out.)

Dale: You're looking kinda tired, Mitch. Why don't you give up, and go play ping-pong with your flabby friends? Ha ha ha!

(Muscle Man starts whimpering.)

Hi-Five Ghost: We believe in you, Muscle Man. (echoes) Man. Man. Man.

(When Muscle Man hears the echoes, he starts to go for the Shredder)

Chaz: Oh, what's this? I think Muscle Man is going for the Shredder.

Rigby: (gasps) Not the Shredder!

(Muscle Man wravels himself and is about to go behind the head for the hand clasp as he's almost reaches for his hands.)

Hi-Five Ghost: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!

(Muscle Man finally clasps his hands together and begins to glow. Dale stops laughing as he notices this. Muscle Man glows an even brighter light, startling the bodybuilders. His Shredder start to shred the whole competition.)

Judge #3: Perfection.

(The Shredder continues to shred.)

Guys: Woah!

(Muscle Man stops glowing as he unwravels himself. The crowd cheers for him.)

Chaz: The winner of the Power Tower Biceptennial, Muscle Man!

(The crowd cheers as he receives the Biceptennial trophy and poses. His friends join him and chant.)

Mordecai, Rigby, and High Five Ghost: Muscle Man! Muscle Man!  Muscle Man!

(Muscle Man sees some familiar ghost faces.)

Muscle Dad: You did it, son. I'm proud of ya.

Denunzio: Si, as am I. You did what I could not.

Dale: (approaching Muscle Man) Hey! I'm so sorry I doubted you bro. You always were number one, Muscle Man. (clasps hands with Muscle Man and pulls out a box) Here, these are for you guys.

Rigby: (takes box, opens it and gasps) Ping pong balls!

Mordecai: Aw, yeah! Game on!

Muscle Man: Uhh, maybe later, bros. My muscles are killing me.

Commentator: Well folks, it's another glorious Thanksgiving at the Buckner Memorial Arena. The game is sponsored by Richard M. Buckner of Buckmart super stores.

Richard: Buckmart, buck$mart.

Commentator Bill: The Skycats and the Mud Pidgeons are neck-in-neck this season, and things have certainly been heating up in the kitchen.

Commentator Chuck: You said a thorough mouthful there, Bill!

Commentator Bill: Ho ho, thanks Chuck! Let's see which team will be destined to take home the turkey!

(cut to the door to the kitchen. There is a sign saying "Moredecai and Rigby KEEP OUT!!". Skips enters the kitchen wearing an apron. Pops is laying out the Thanksgiving dinner. Skips goes to check on the turkey. Benson comes in while checking the schedule,)

Benson: How's the turkey comin', Skips?

Skips: Needs another hour to cook.

Benson: Good, good, we're on schedule. Once Muscle Man get back with the pies, we should have everything set. All that's left is picking up everyone's relatives from the airport.

Pops: Oh, how wonderful it will be to give thanks with family here!

(cut to the living room where the table for Thanksgiving is being set up by Mordecai and Rigby. Mordecai starts beatboxing.)

Rigby: ♪Yeah, it's fun watching football on cable

But it's not Thanksgiving if you don't set up the table!

Mordecai: ♪This is for the turkey, this is for the stuffin

You don't got etiquette, you don't got nothin'!

Rigby: ♪Etiquette!♪

Mordecai: ♪Etiquette!♪

Rigby: (using plates as turntables) ♪Eti-eti-eti-eti-etiquette!♪

(both laugh. Benson, Pops and Skips come in)

Benson: Hey, you two. We're going upstairs to fix up the rooms for the guests. Remember: no football in the house!

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. No football in the house. Cheeeeeck.

Benson: And stay out of the kitchen. (leaves with Pops and Skips) I don't want you guys messing anything up.

Mordecai: Bam! Table set.

Rigby: You know what that means? (holds up football) Footbaaaaall!

Mordecai: Dude, did you not hear what Benson said? No football in the house.

Rigby: He didn't say anything about foam football in the house. (squeezes ball)

Mordecai: Dude.....time to go looooong!

(Mordecai and Rigby start playing foam football. When Rigby dodges Mordecai while in possession of the ball, Mordecai tackles him to the ground. The foam footbal flies out of Rigby's hands, and starts heading towards...)

Mordecai and Rigby: (slow motion) The kitchen!

(They scream in slow motion as they run towards the kitchen to retrieve the ball. Just as it's about to go over the gate, Rigby catches it at the last second.)

Rigby: Phew. Good thing this Child Safety gate was here.

(The gate suddenly breaks off. Rigby falls and the ball flies out of his hands, again.)

Mordecai and Rigby: (in slow motion, again) Noooooo!

(The chain of events is as follows: the foam football bounces over a bowl of food and a cup, over a fryer standing on a skateboard for some reason, then it stops briefly, knocking a can to the side, causing it to roll into a stack of clean dishes in the sink, and they crash. One of the dishes roll on their side and into a mop, causing the mop handle to lean back on the handle of a pan with a spoon inside on the stove. The spoon flies out of the pan and up on the spinning fan, causing it to break and land directly on the Thanksgiving feast. It continues spinning on the food, and the bowls of food fall off the table and break. The orange yams fall off the table; followed by the still-spinning fan directly on them, sending them all over the floor. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost come in with the pies.)

Muscle Man: Ugh, it took forever to get these pi- (steps on a slippery yam and starts squealing and slipping as he drops the pies and slams into the turkey which flies out.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aaaaaah!

(The turkey lands into the fryer, causing it to burst into flames. The skateboard starts rolling off the table, heading straight for Mordecai and Rigby, who jump out of harm's way. The skateboard goes out the kitchen past the dining area, through the hallway --where Benson Pops and Skips were coming down the stairs,-- and out the door, where Mordecai and Rigby were just chasing it. The skateboard and the turkey speed up the ramp, and the turkey explodes in the air, sending chunks of it up on the house roof. The duo is shocked and they look at Benson, Pops and Skips, who are shocked as well. Scene cuts back to the ruined kitchen. Everyone is angry at Mordecai and Rigby)

Benson: (picks up the foam football) What have you DONE?! (throws it between Mordecai and Rigby) The guests are arriving in a few hours! Now what do we do?! Ugh! I can't believe this! It's one thing to ruin my day, which is practically your job. (Mordecai and Rigby are more guilty than ever) But your own families? Don't you care about anything? (sighs) This is the worst thing you've ever done.

(The others walk up to Benson.)

Hi Five Ghost: Maybe we can fix this. What if me and Muscle Man go to get more sides?

Thomas: Yeah, and I could pick everyone up from the airport.

Skips: (nodding) It's worth a try. Pops, Benson, let's go get another turkey.

(Everyone walks out of the kitchen except for Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: We can help too!

(Everyone turns to him.)

Benson: I think you've helped enough.

(They continue walking out of the house. Mordecai and Rigby try to catch up with them.)

Rigby: Sorry! (Benson closes the front door behind him.) Aw, man, we really messed up big this time.

Mordecai: I know. They'll never find a turkey this late. If we don't fix this, our families won't have a Thanksgiving.

Rigby: And we'll be fired.

Mordecai: That, too. What are we gonna do?

(They see a commercial on T.V about Farmer Jimmy.)

Farmer Jimmy: Don't have a turkey yet? Not gonna find one? It's me! Farmer Jimmy at Farmer JImmy's Turkey Farm. I love Thanksgiving, but you already know that! What you may not know is that I also have a love and appreciation for pop music! (plays rock tune) And it really rustles my jimmies that there's no Thanksgiving song. That's where you come in! I'm holding a contest at my farm. Whoever writes the best catchy radio-friendly Thanksgiving tune wins my prized turducken. That's a turkey stuffed with a duck stuffed with a chicken. Everybody knows that. For decades, turduckens have been engineered by man. What you may not know is that one get born naturally every million years. (checks the time) Oh, the contest starts in half an hour. I gotta get ready!

Mordecai: Dude, this is perfect!

Rigby: Yeah, man. We're great at songs.

Mordecai and Rigby: We're gonna save Thanksgiving!

(Cuts to Mordecai and Rigby driving out in the country. Rigby has a keyboard)

Mordecai: Now what was it we were singing? (Rigby plays keyboard) Something, something pumpkin. Blah-blah-blah stuffing. Uhh...

Rigby: Eating lots of food!

Mordecai: Yeah! Eating lots of food!

Mordecai and Rigby: Chomp chomp! Chomp chomp!

Rigby: More than I can chew!

Mordecai and Rigby: Chomp chomp! Chomp chomp! Football, football. Fall aslep on couch! Slip into food coma!

Rigby: Yeah-yuh! This is gold!

Mordecai: We still gotta come up with that first line though.

Rigby: It'll come to us. Besides, I got a secret weapon. (whips out spoons) Bam!

Mordecai: Spoons?

Rigby: Sure, in the hands of a normal guy, but in the hands of a Rigby? (starts hamboning with spoons) Spoonboning!

Mordecai: Dude, Rigby, gotta tell you that's like, (mimics explosion) blowin' my mind right now. We're totally gonna win! Aw, yeah!

Mordecai and Rigby: Mordo and Rigs save Thanksgiving! Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah! 

(Cuts to a place called The Side Line. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are walking inside.)

Muscle Man: This place has the best sides. (We see someone wth an order of two big sides and small bowls of small sides.) Even the sides got sides.

(Muscle Man and Fives approach the front desk.)

Billie: Muscle Man!

Muscle Man: Yo, Billie! (they hi five)

Billie: (chuckles) What can I get you, bro?

Muscle Man: (pointing at the menu) This one. Mashed potatoes, corn on the cob, stuffing, yams and greens for 50.

Billie: Aw, yeah. The Hail Mary platter. (Goes to the kitchen) Got it, brosive

(Muscle Man and Fives start watching tv.)

Announcer: And now back to the top End Zones dances of all time. #4, Brock Stettman!

(we are shpwn Stettman doing an end zone dance.)

Muscle Man: Man, who made this list? Stettman's dance are lame.

Hi Five Ghost: Hey Stettman, who taught you those moves? A dead cat?

(Muscle Man and Fives laugh.)

Muscle Man: You know who else had the better end zone dance? My--(someone places a hand on his shoulder) mom?

Brock: (with other footballers) Brock Stettman will crush you.

(Scene cuts to Buck Mart.)

Skips: Look, there's one left.

(There's one turkey in the freezer. Benson, Pops and Skips walk up to it.)

Benson: Oh, thank goodness. (Takes the turkey) The last turkey.

(The three walk away.)

Pops: Wow, how fortunate.

(A pilgrim, an Indian and a man dressed in a turkey costume are watching them from an aisle. The pilgrim looks at his list, and it is evident that these three need a turkey, too. After paying for the turkey, Pops, Benson and Skips head back to the car. The three characters from earlier show up.)

Pilgrim: Good morning, fine sirs. Pretty pardon, would you like some help putting that turkey into your car?

Pops: Oh, no. We're fine.

(Turkey character punches Pops, then takes the turkey. The pilgrim, indian and turkey character rush into their truck and drive off. Benson and Skips help Pops.)

Benson: Pops, are you ok?

Pops: (groans) That turkey stole our turkey!

(Cut back to Mordecai and Rigby. They are being held up by traffic. Mordecai groans as Rigby checks the sign. They are 10 minutes away from the farm.)

Rigby: Dude, we're never gonna make it! (Mordecai sighs and starts to exit the traffic) Whoa! Hey! What are you doing?!

Mordecai: I got an idea.

(Cut to Mordecai knocking the door of somebody's house. Frank Smith answers the door.)

Frank: Diaper boy!

Rigby: What's Margaret's dad doing here? (Mordecai glares at him.)

Frank: I live here. (To Mordecai) Sorry, Margaret's not here. She's with her new boyfriend.(Mordecai is shocked. Frank chuckles) I'm kidding. She's working on a term paper.

Mordecai: (chuckles nervously) Well, we're not here to see Margaret.

Frank: Oh. Well, uhh, you guys wanna come in? We got plenty to eat.

Mordecai: No, thanks, Mr. Smith. We need a favor. Without your help, our Thanksgiving will be ruined.

Frank: (to Denise Smith) Denise, wrap up some turkey sandwiches. Daddy's gotta save Thanksgiving.

(We are shown Frank's helicopter flying off. Cut back to The Side Line, where Muscle Man is squealing at the sight of Brock Stettman himself.)

Brock: Brock Stettman will crush you. (has a smile) In an end zone dance-off!

Muscle Man: Huh?

(Everyone cheers as Muscle Man and Brock Stettman get in their positions.)

Brock: Ball me, James. (James gives Brock a football. Muscle Man stares at Brock as he perform his end zone dance. Brock concludes with a football throwdown. Everyone cheers) Beat that!

Muscle Man: Pssh. Easy. (picks up football and starts mimicking those moves)

Brock: Well, bless my pigskin. He's doing the typewriter. Oh, snap! Now he's sealing an envelope. Sending a letter, receiving a letter. Taking it up the river. Going for the full split!

(When Muscle Man splits, he hurts himself and squeals. Everyone is surprised. Fives goes over to him as he groans.)

Muscle Man: My hammie, bro.

Brock: (Takes the football from Muscle Man) Lesson learned. Brock Stettman is the king of end zone dancing! Whoo! (throws the football down, and it bounces. Billie comes back with the order of sides.)

Billie: Muscle Man, your sides is...(The football smashes into the platter, destroying it. Brock, Muscle Man and Fives are shocked.) Ready.

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro. (falls back and squeals)

(Cut to a car chase scene. The pilgrim, indian and turkey character are driving off with the turkey. The indian checks the mirror and sees Benson, Pops and Skips in hot pursuit of the turkey.)

Indian: We got company.

(Carmenita appears on the left side of the truck.)

Benson: Give us back the turkey!

Pilgrim: Baste 'em.

(The turkey character opens the left side door. Benson, Pops and Skips gasp, and he uses a flamethrower on the three, who scream but are able to evade the fire. The turkey character stops as he notices a truck heading for the other. The indian quickly swerves, but the turkey flies out of the pilgrim's hands. Skips catches it just as the oncoming truck drives in between. The indian's truck sudden stutters on it's front wheel, starting an oil slick.)

Thanksgiving Characters: No!

(The truck rolls away with the characters, and explodes.)

Benson: (looking back) Ha, yes!

(The thanksgiving characters have survived the explosion and are running toward them.)

Thanksgiving Characters: Hup two, hup two, hup two...

Benson: What the...

(The Indian jumps onto Carmenita and fights over the turkey with Skips.)

Indian: This turkey is ours!

(Skips pulls the turkey away, but he leans down on Pops, who turns the car, causing both the turkey and the indian to fall off onto the road. Carmenita continues to swerve as Benson, Pops and Skips are about to crash into a BuckMart sign. They scream.)


AD
Part 2
(The special continues from where we left off. Benson, Pops and Skips scream as they head for the BuckMart sign. Pops puts the brakes on Carmenita, just in time.)

Skips: Quick, the turkey!

(Benson, Pops, Skips, and the Thanksgiving characters approach the turkey, only for it to be run over by a moped driver.)

Benson: (turns red and winces) URRRRRRRRRRRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!

(The screen pans up to the sky, where Frank's helicopter is passing by at that moment.)

Mordecai and Rigby: ♪Chomp chomp! Chomp chomp! Football, football, fall asleep on couch. Slip into food coma!♪

Frank: Criminy, that's all you got?

Mordecai: Well, and also.... (Rigby spoonbones and Mordecai stops him)

Frank: Boys, it's gonna take more than silverware to win this contest. You have to sing from the heart. Plus, you still need to figure out that first line.

Mordecai: Yeah, you're right.

Rigby: At least all the other contestants so far aren't very good.

(Farmer Jimmy appears on the copter screen.)

Farmer Jimmy: Ok, unless there are some other contestants after this, we're down to our last entry! (Cut to the contest) Everybody welcome, Rich Buckner!

(Rich comes riding on the stage.)

Audience: (gasps) Rich Buckner.

Mordecai, Rigby and Frank: Rich Buckner?!

Rich: Now, I know what's going through your head: "That's Rich Buckner. He's the richest man in the world. What's he doing here!" Well, I love Thanksgiving, so I paid the best musicians in the world to write this song.

Farmer Jimmy: That sounds like it'll be good!

Rich: It is. And remember, shop at BuckMart for all your Thanksgiving needs. (rides off to the side of the stage.)

Farmer Jimmy: Ok, give it up for Rich Buckner and his song, Chewing On Freedom!

(Farmer Jimmy walks off the stage as music begins to play, and spotlights and smoke appear on the stage. Everyone is amazed. Multi-lights appear from the sides.)

Dusty B: Alright everybody, we're about to drop the true meaning of Thanksgiving on y'all!

(A hologram of the American flag is shown.)

Man: It's the American flag! It's the American flag!

(Three shadows appears in the smoke. A spotlight shines o the first one as she sings.)

(Song: Chewing on Freedom)

Jennifer: You're freezing cold, chilly and pimply, on this cold Thanksgiving's Eve!

Guy: Pop sensation Jennifer!

(A spotlight appears on the third shadow.)

Auto T.: Caress your body, butter your skin, bake in over for 100 degrees!

Guy: Aw, snap! Auto T.!

(Spotlight appears on the middle shadow.)

Dusty B: Baby, seeing you roast in there, my heart fills with pride.

Twins: (scream) Dusty B!

All 3: Where else but America, can we feast on your meat?

(Rich Buckner nods at his performance. Jennifer, Auto and Dusty move to the sides as dozen of familiar characters appear on the stage.)

Everyone: When you're eating a turkey, you're eating America! When you chew on some sides, you're chewing on freedom! Thanksgiving Day in the USA, when you're chewing on freedom!

(Background characters dance and musicians play.)

Everyone: Baste the turkey, stuffing is good with Buckner breading carrots and peas. (We are shown a blimp promoting BuckMart. The crowd likes it.) Turkey's tender, sides are perfect, Buckner products we did it with ease. Let's give thanks to Richard Buckner and bow down gratefully! (4 Pilgrims come to the middle of the stage and revive someone) Let's eat this bird patriodically, as a family!

(Back at the plane)

Frank: Popular music stars, laser flags, reviving the dead! You better come up with something fast!

(Mordecai and Rigby practically continue working on their song as they get closer to the contest.)

Everyone: ...When you chew on some sides, you're chewing on freedom! Thanksgiving day in the USA! When you're chewiiiing....

Dusty B.: Ooooooonnnnnn!

Everyone: Freeeeeee....doooooooooooom

(A man glides in with an American banner. A bunch of guys tackle him. Two cars jump off ramps and crash into each other. Fire machile brighten the stage, followed by 3 jets. The song finishes there. The audience cheers. Rich comes back on the stage, and exits everyone off. Farmer Jimmy appears witth his prized turducken.)

Farmer Jimmy: Oh, my stars! Well, unless someone's gonna come down here in the next few seconds, Mr. Buckner, I am proud to award you (Rich notices Frank's jet) my one-of-a-kind, blue ribbon, prize-winning...

Rigby: Stooooooop! 

(Mordecai pulls the rope ladder, and he and Rigby climb down it onto the stage. The duo wave as the jet flies off.)

Mordecai: Our names are Mordecai and Rigby, and we got a song too!

Rich: It's too late.

Farmer Jimmy: Just hold on there, Richard. They made it in just under the wire.

Rich: What?!

Farmer Jimmy: The pilgrims took a chance coming to the new world. Let's take a chance on these fellas.

Audience: Let them play! Let them play!

Rich: Ugh, fine! (walks off)

Farmer Jimmy: Well, Mordecai and Rigby, the stage is yours. (pulls the turducken off the stage)

Rigby: (whispering) Ah, dude, I still don't know what the first line is!

Mordecai: (whispering) Just go with the 'pumpkin and stuffing' line.

Rigby: (whispering) Alright.

(Mordecai and  Rigby are about to take their microphones, when Mordecai takes a call.)

Thomas: Mordecai and Rigby, come in. It's Thomas.

Mordecai: Thomas?

(Thomas is at the airport, checking the flights.)

Thomas: I'm at the airport. There's been a delay. Your family's flights won't be getting in till tomorrow. I'm so sorry. (Mordecai and Rigby are shocked) They're not gonna make it for Thanksgiving. (this is echoed is we see all the families gathered for dinner) Sorry.

(Mordecai drops the walkie-talkie and sighs.)

Rigby: What the point of having Thanksgiving without family? (drops paper) I'm outta here.

Rich: Yes!

(Rigby starts to walk off, but Mordecai signals him to stop.)

Mordecai: Rigby, wait. Don't you see? This is what the song needs to be about. (Rigby looks at him and walks back. Mordecai takes his mic.) Today was a hard day for us, and well... (gulps) We really hope you like our song. (sighs and begins to sing)

(Song: What Are You Thankful For? (Thanksgiving!))

Mordecai: We wrecked our turkey on Thanksgiving Day, knocked onto the floor and it burst into flames. Without a turkey we were freaking out, but that's not what it's really all about.

(Guitarist starts to play, and nods his head signaling Rigby to sing, who nods back.)

Rigby: Sure it's great to have all that food, but really what puts you in a better mood, (all Mordecai and Rigby's friends are watching) is sitting down next to your best buddies and having quality time with your family.

(Drummer joins in.)

Mordecai: Things are bound to go wrong maybe once or twice. Who cares if the dog ate all the sides?

Rigby: We all must put our differences aside. It's only one day so we have to try.

Mordecai and Rigby: It's not about stuffing or gravy, all the food is bonus, now don't you see? For one day a year all is forgiven...

Twins: Oh, Rigby!

Mordecai and Rigby: ...when we come together on Thanksgiving. (Farmer Jimmy claps along while Rich glances at the audience and grunts before walking away.) When we come together on Thanksgiving.... (The audience memebers hug. Rigby gets them to clap along.) When we come together on Thanksgiving. (A spotlight is shone on Rigby as he starts spoonboning.) Oh whoa, what are you thankful for?

Audience: Thanksgiving!

Man: Spoonboning! (his eyes water)

Modrecai and Rigby: What are you thankful for?

Audience: Thanksgiving!

Mordecai and Rigby: What are you thankful for? Oh whoa...

(Benson, Pops and Skips are touched.)

Benson: I forgive you.

Mordecai and Rigby: Oh whoa, what are you thankful for?

Audience: Thanksgiving!

(Another guitarist takes off his shirt and plays a finishing riff.)

Mordecai and Rigby: What are you thankful for?

Audience: Thanksgiving!

Mordecai and Rigby: What are you thankful for?

(They look at each other panting as the song ends. The audience cheers.)

Man: That was awesome! (embraces his family) I love you guys! I'm so thankful that my whole family looks exactly like me!

Farmer Jimmy: Well, I do declare! It seems to me as though we have a new winner!

(The audience cheers for Mordecai and Rigby again, along with Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Brock Stettman and the Skycats, Benson, Pops, Skips and the Thanksgiving characters.)

Mordecai: Yeah!

Rigby; Yeah-yuh!

(They hi five. Farmer Jimmy goes to them with the turducken.)

Farmer Jimmy: Mordecai and Rigby, your song captured the true spirit of Thanksgiving. And I hereby present you with the grand prize of Farmer Jimmy's honest-to-goodness turducken!

(The turducken is snagged by a grappling hook, and everyone gasps and screams as it is being carried up into Rich Buckner's blimp. Rich laughs.)

Mordecai: Hey, what are you doing?! That's our turducken!

Rich: (putting the turducken inside the blimp) I tried to buy it from him but he wouldn't let me. So I spent millions on the perfect song. You guys just sang from the heart! That doesn't cost anything!

Rigby: Give us our turducken!

Rich: I'm afraid I can't do that. But we might have an extra turkey laying around somewhere (pulls out a turkey) Oh, hey! Looks like we do! Here ya (throws turkey) go! (The turkey fall apart when it hits the ground, and hits Rigby, who screams) Clean up on aisle six! (starts dancing and whooping as the blimp gets away)

Mordecai: What are we gonna do?!

(A gust of wind brushes through Mordecai and Rigby as Frank and his helicopter arrives.)

Frank: Grab on, boys. We got a bad guy to catch.

(Mordecai and Rigby run to the rope ladder and grab on as the helicopter heads toward the BuckMart blimp. Cut back to Benson, Pops, Skips and the Thanksgiving characters watching this.)

Pilgrim: This is an outrage! That song was the embodiment of all that holds true and dear about Thanksgiving.

Benson: And that's why we're gonna help them get that turducken back! Now are you with us or not?

Indian: It would be our honor.

(Cut back to the Side Line.)

Brock: Hey, Muscle Man, I got the team jet parked outside with my entire defensive line on it. What do you say we go intercept that turducken?

Muscle Man: I say game on, bro. (Cut to the Skycats jet. Muscle Man is wearing the team shirt. He takes it off and spins it as he whoops. The jet closes and the team takes off.)

(Cut to the blimp. Mordecai, Rigby and Frank have just about reached it. Frank attaches a zipline onto the blimp. Mordecai shakes his hand before him and Rigby head down the zipline wearing their harnesses, and get on the blimp. They burst through the door. Rich is sitting as a table complete with a Thanksgiving feast, along with the turducken.)

Mordecai: Hand over the turducken!

Rich: Mordecai and Rigby. Have a seat. (They do so.) You may be wondering why a billionaire wants this turducken so much.

Mordecai: I don't know. Does it taste really good or something?

Rich: You really think I'm gonna eat this? You don't know anything, do you? It's true that just one is born every million years, but what no one knows....(sticks his hand inside the turducken, grossing out Mordecai and Rigby. He pulls out a wishbone, made of solid gold.)... is that it has a golden wishbone! One that actually grants wishes!

Mordecai: But what could you possibly wish for? You're a billionaire!

Rich: The one thing that my attorneys tell me I can't buy: the rights to Thanksgiving! (They gasp as he goes to his fireplace) I run a successful business, employ thousands. Do I ever get the thanks? Giving? No. Everyone's too busy with their families. Soon they will all have to thank me! (moves chair aside) Thanksgiving, brought to you by BuckMart.

Mordecai and Rigby: No! (They tackle him down)

Rich: Go! (kicks them away)

Rigby: Spoonboning!

Rich: Huh! (Rigby spoonbones toward him) No! No!

(Mordecai grabs the wishbone. Cut to the Skycats jet flying directly over the BuckMart blimp.)

Muscle Man: Air tackle the blimp! Go! Go! Go! (three team members tackle at his marks. Brock stands by him.) Alright, Stettman. Let's see some fancy footwork out there.

(He and Stettman whoop as they tackle down the blimp together. The three team members tackle the blimp, but fail to make a cut. Muscle Man uses his cleats to rip three hole in the blimp. Cut back to Rich fighting Mordecai and Rigby for the wishbone when they notice Muscle Man cheering through the window. They resume fighting. We are then shown Pops, Benson, Skips and the Thanksgiving characters riding Carmenita toward the blimp. The indian fires 3 arrows at it, causing the blimp to catch on fire and heading toward the bridge. The pilots are having toward flying the blimp.)

Pilot: (grunts) Abandon ship!

(They run out of the blimp and escape via parachute. The fight inside continues as Rich has the wishbone and he kicks Mordecai away.)

Rich: (looking at the wishbone) Finally, Thanksgiving is gonna be mine! (Rigby tries to grab the wishbone while Mordecai punches him in the face) Ugh! Get offa me! Ahhh!

Mordecai: You can take what you want, but you could never take Thanksgiving from us!

Rich: Oh yeah? Well, I've got a golden wishbone right here that says otherwise! (kicks Mordecai and Rigby out, who scream while falling. Rich laughs) Thanks for shopping at BuckMart! (holds up what appears to be the wishbone) I wish for Thanksgiving to be mine! And another billion dollars in an untraceable Swiss bank account! (breaks it apart, but immediately discovers it wasn't the wishbone, but Rigby's spoons) Nooooo! (notices the blimp about to crash into the bridge) NOOOOOOOO!

(The blimp explodes. We are shown Mordecai and Rigby still in freefall, and are revealed to be holding the wishbone.)

Mordecai: We wish to be safe at home with our friends and family! Now!

(They try to break it apart.)

Rigby: Why isn't it breaking?!

Mordecai: 'Cause it's soild gold, man! Here, try this! (moves to a sitting position)

Rigby: Okay! (does the same)

(Mordecai and Rigby are headed for the ground.)

Mordecai: Pull harder!

(Rigby grunts as he pulls. They they both pull, and finally the wishbone breaks apart, and the two disappear with a puff of smoke. They reappear in front of Pops's house, falling with a thud. Pops, Benson, Skips and the Thanksgiving characters fly down to them.)

Benson: What happened?

Mordecai: The golden wishbone. We wished to come back home safe and sound, and it worked!

Rigby: Well, almost. It didn't grant the part where our families would be here.

(They look down in sadness. Thomas runs out of the house at that moment.)

Thomas: Guys, guys! Remember when I said everyone wasn't coming? I was wrong! (Mordecai and Rigby's parents start coming out) I checked the departing flights instead of the arrivals.

Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops and Skips: Thomas!

Mordecai's Father: Hey, Mordo!

Mordecai's Mother: Hi son.

Rigby's Mother: Is that grown man over there my Rigby?

Rigby's Father: Come here, Rigby!

(Mordecai and Rigby run up to them.)

Rigby: Mom! Pop!

Mordecai: It's so good to see you guys! Except, well...

Rigby: There's no food because we destroyed it all.

Rigby's Father: (laughs) Well, that's what families are for.

(He opens the door and Mordecai and Rigby are surprised; a new Thanksgiving feast has been prepared by all the families.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah!

Thomas's Mom: (holding a turkey) Who's ready for some turkey?

(Everyone cheers. We then see the turkey with the feast. All the performers, footballers and Thanksgiving characters, as well as some friends, have joined everyone. Some people are chatting, until Benson taps a glass of cold watr with a spoom.)

Benson: Ahem!

Benson's Father: Oh? (to everyone) Hey, everybody! Pipe down! (to Benson) Go ahead, son.

Benson: I just wanna thank everyone for coming. Thanksgiving can be a hectic time for many. But to see everyone here makes it all worth it in the end. Mordecai and Rigby, would you please stand up? (They do so) I know you guys aren't perfect, pretty much all the time. But I want you to know that I'm proud of you. You saved Thanksgiving! And for that, I raise my glass. (Mordecai and Rigby look at each other) Happy Thanksgiving, everyone.

All: Happy Thanksgiving!

Rigby: Man, Timmy's so awesome.

Hi Five Ghost: I can't believe he's already turning ten.

Muscle Man: Seriously. We watched that kid grow up, bro.

(Flashback to Timmy's first birthday)

All: Happy birthday, Timmy!

(Timmy licks his cake, then he smothers his face in it. Everyone laughs. We are then shown Timmy at his pirate-themed party. He is standing on the plank.)

Timmy: Guys, guys! Check it out! I'm gonna walk the plank like a real pirate!

(Jumps off the plank into the ball pit)

Timmy (continued): Arrgh!

(Rigby and Muscle Man share a laugh. Cut to Timmy's astronaut-themed party.)

Benson; And the winner of the astronaut ice cream-eating contest is....Timmy!

(Everyone cheers. Fives puts a spaceman hat on Timmy as everyone laughs.)

Timmy: You guys always make my birthdays the best!

(Flashbacks end)

Rigby: Man, Timmy's parties just keep getting better every year.

Mordecai: Yeah. We gotta make sure this stuntman party is the best one yet.

Benson: (On mobile phone) What do you mean a real stuntman job? But it's a stuntman-themed party! What are we supposed to tell our client?! Well, you can say goodbye to your complimentary fountain sodas, and YOU'LL NEVER STUNT IN THIS PARK AGAIN, MR. HAZARD!

(Hangs up and throws his phone in anger)

Mordecai: Is everything okay, Benson?

Besnon: No, everything is not okay! The stuntman cancelled, and Timmy's party is ruined!

Mordecai: Are you serious?!

Rigby: But Timmy's counting on us!

Benson: I know. But where am I supposed to find a stuntman this late in the game?

Muscle Man: Well, I might know a guy who...actually no. I don't know any stuntmen. Aah! You're losing it, Mitch!

Benson: That's it! We have to cancel Timmy's party!

Rigby: No, wait!

Mordecai: Yeah. Maybe one of us can do the stunt.

Benson: No, it has to be a licensed stuntman. Our insurance doesn't cover amateurs.

Rigby: Well, how hard is it to get a license?

Benson: Hard. The success rate at Stuntman College is only 25%, and you guys aren't exactly stuntman material.

Mordecai: But if it's 25%, then one of us should be able to do it, right?

Benson: (Turns red) You think you'll beat the odds like that in one day?

Muscle Man: If that's what it'll take to make Timmy happy, then we'll do it!

Rigby: Yeah. It's the only chance we have.

Mordecai: We're done with all the party prep. I'll enroll us right now.

Benson: Okay, but one of you better come back with a stuntman license, or else Timmy's birthday or probably his life are gonna be ruined.

(Scene cuts to the Stuntman College)

Mordecai: Are you sure this is the right place?

Muscle Man: (Holding up the brochure) It's the address that was on the brochure.

Rigby: (Standing next to a stuntman statue) This is definitely the right place. Johnny Crasher is a living legend! Before he retired, he went in and out of over forty comas. No other stuntman has survived anywhere near that many.

(Motorbike engine sounds up)

Muscle Man: Huh?

Rigby: Johnny Crasher!

Johnny Crasher: Yeeha!

(Makes a wheelie and then proceeds to stand on the seat. He ends up crashing, and Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Fives clap.)

Rigby: Whoa, did you see that roll?

Johnny Crasher: Not part of the stunt! 

(Takes his helmet off)

Rigby: Ahh! Are you okay?

Johnny Crasher: Yes! Are you trying to say I look bad after bein' in forty comas!?

Rigby: Are you -- (Switches his sights to his right side) -- talking to me? Because...

(Points finger to his eye, hinting Johnny's misdirected eyeballs)

Johnny Crasher: Yeah, I'm talking to you! You think this stuntman is supposed to be pretty? You think (Interrupted by screams in pain) -- these headaches! Ok! Well, unless you're just here to drop off your recycling, let's get started! 

(Cut to the guys except Fives sitting on crates in front of Crasher) 

Johnny Crasher (continued): Here are your stunt textbooks! (Hands books out) They contain everything you need to know to complete this course! You should read these in case I forget to teach you something important, which is very likely because I've been in forty comas. You may think you have what it takes to be a stuntman, but I'm here to tell ya, none of that matters if you can't do one thing: A stuntman's gotta hit his marks! If you can't do that, (Muscle Man nods) you are worthless!

(Has a bucket in his hands)

Johnny Crasher (continued): Now, uh, before I give away any other freebies, there's a little matter of tuition. Cash your money orders only.

(The guys cash in the money)

Johnny Crasher (continued): That'll just about make up for the way things turned out. So just a few warnings while you're still in the comfort of your chairs. You're gonna be breakin' bones out there. You're gonna be gettin' your teeth knocked out, your faces smashed, your eyeballs ripped out! Anybody wanna quit yet?! No? Alright, good.

Rigby: He's just being dramatic, right?

Johnny Crasher: Hey, little guy. I'm sorry, do you wanna teach the class?! Maybe you should get up here on the mark and show everybody how to take a punch. Huh?!

Rigby: Buu...

Johnny Crasher: Now!

(Rigby steps up to the mark)

Mordecai: Good luck, dude.

(Johnny punches Rigby the moment he's on the mark)

Muscle Man: Yeah! Whoo hoo! Teach us, teacher!

Johnny Crasher: You think there's something funny about stunts?

Muscle Man: No, sir! I'm sorry, sir. That looks very serious, sir.

Johnny Crasher: It was, but I don't think you realize how serious. So why don't you get up here and take the next punch?

(Muscle Man does so)

Johnny Crasher (continued): Back to your crib, you little baby.

(Rigby goes back to his seat as he and Muscle Man groan simultaneously.)

Muscle Man: So are there any secr-

(Gets interrupted by punch and squeals and cries)

Mordecai: (Puts hand up) I'm confused. Aren't we supposed to learn how to take a fake punch?

Johnny Crasher: Oh, you're confused. Ah, okay. Why don't you get on this mark so that I can punch you in the face?!

Mordecai: Uhh...

(A montage of the stuntman course begins. The first part is Endurance, where the guys have to avoid getting hurt by Johnny Crasher as he rides his motorbike right behind them. The second part is Rolling Over Cars, where Johnny trains them to roll over a car one by one. The third part is Introduction to Pain, where the guys make crazy motions until Johnny signals his assistants to smash fake chairs on them. The fourth part is Getting Dragged 101, where the guys are hanging onto ropes while Johnny drags them along on a boat. Objects are thrown at them to knock them off course, but Muscle Man manages to hang onto a buoy and save himself. The fifth part is How to Fall, where the guys have to fall on their own marks. At the Locker Room, Muscle Man pulls out a picture of him and Timmy, which the others find cool, and they take out their photos with Timmy as well. After taking more parts of the stuntman course, and the twenty-fourth one where they walk from an explosion and look cool, the guys have reached the final exam.)

Johnny Crasher: (Clapping) Well, well, well. You passed basic training. Congratulations! By the way, I'm being sarcastic.

(Everyone agrees)

Hi Five Ghost: It was your tone and the eye-rolling thing.

Johnny Crasher (continued): You've gone from being delicate butterflies to slightly less delicate butterflies. It don't mean NOTHIN'! If you want your stuntman licenses, you have to pass my final exam!

Guys: Final exam?

(Johnny presses a button, and the curtain behind him reveals a full stuntman course. Cut to the guys at the start.)

Johnny Crasher: This ain't no mamby-pamby true or false test. It's five and a half acres of pure pain! And if you survive that, you just hit your mark, and you'll get your license.

Mordecai, Rigby and Muscle Man: Uhhh....

(Mordecai phone rings and he answers it.)

Benson: Where are you guys?

(Cut to a panicked Benson)

Mordecai: Uhh, we're about to take the stuntman exam.

Benson: Well, hurry. We need a-

(He hears a car honking. It is Timmy's mother, who opens the door for Timmy and the kids. Timmy is playing a video game.

Timmy: Uncle Benson!

Benson: (on the phone) Timmy's here! Uh, I'll stall! ( puts on the goofiest false smile you've ever seen) Tiiiiiiimmy!

(Cut back to the guys)

Muscle Man: Bros, come on! Bring it in!

(The other come in and put their hands in.)

Muscle Man (continued): The odds say at least one of us will make it.

Guys: 1, 2, 3!

Muscle Man: Who's this for?!

(They put theit hands in the air.)

Guys: Timmy!

(They walk up to Crasher)

Johnny Crasher: You ready?!

Guys: Sir, yes sir!

Johnny Crasher: Starting positions!

(The guys hop into their shopping carts.)

Johnny Crasher (continued): Get set! Go!

(The guys scream as they speed down the ramp.)

Johnny Crasher (continued): Good luck, cadets!

(The guys continue screaming down the ramp until their shopping carts splash into the water. They fly out and hang onto zipline cables as they zip along. They crash through wooden panels, and this action is seen in three different shots. When they land, all but Fives is still active. He starts coughing.)

Hi Five Ghost: Bros, go on without me. I can't take it.

Muscle Man: What? No!

Hi Five Ghost: Just now, going through those wooden panels, it felt like we went through three times or something.

Rigby: What about Timmy?!

(Fives puts his hand on Muscle Man's.)

Hi Five Ghost: Timmy's a great kid. Be great for him.

(He turns and lies motionless.)

Mordecai: We got to go!

(The guys continue running.)

Guys: Timmy! Timmy!

(They go over two parked up cars, and jump off a netboard over explosives which set off st that moment, and they catch fire. The guys stop on a ramp where two guys extinguish them.They continue running faster as a car rushes behind them. They eventually hop onto the top of the car as a second one comes next to it.)

Muscle Man: Don't try this at home!

(He carefully moves to the top of the other car.) 

Muscle Man (continued): Come on, bros!

(He looks in front and sees a ramp in approach. The drivers swerve on both sides of the ramp as a helicopter rides above them. The guys grabs onto the landing skids and the cars crash into a fake house. As the helicopter moves on, Mordecai begins to lose grip.)

Rigby and Muscle Man: Mordecai!

Mordecai: Dudes.... cant... hold on!

Muscle Man: But you gotta!

Mordecai: Tell Timmy.....i'm sorry.

(The skid Mordecai is grabbing breaks and he screams as he falls.)

Rigby and Muscle Man: Nooooooo!

(Mordecai falls on the landing mat. Rigby and Muscle Man let go of the skids and land on the mat on top of the building. They start jumoing down until they fall through and go into cannons. They are then shot through a brick wall. Muscle Man slowly gets up.)

Rigby: Go without me, dude.

Muscle Man: What?! We already lost two men!

Rigby: But the pain...

Muscle Man: How about Timmy's emotional pain when his big 1 0 blows! Your pain means nothing! Timmy means everything!

Rigby: You're...right!

(He gets up and they both run over to their motorcycles. They drive past some tires, and jump snakes and alligators on ramps.)

Rigby (continued): Well, at least we didn't have to jump any sharks!

(A cannon fires something in the background.)

Muscle Man: What was that?

(They scream as a metal shark crashes in between them. They look behind and see three more metal sharks being fired at them, and begin dodging.)

Rigby: The final jump! Gun it, bro!

(Muscle Man nods and they speed up. As they head toward the big ramp, which has C-4 explosives, and man set them off. Rigby and Muscle Man become airborne from the explosion and no longer on their motorcycles. Johnny Crasher, at the end of the course, looks through his telescope.)

Johnny Crasher: Oh yeah. Yeah, yeah, this part always gets up!

Rigby: Dude, we're gonna miss our mark!

Muscle Man: Get on my back, bro!

(Rigby does so, and Muscle Man pulls the front of his uniform, revealing a wingsuit.)

Rigby: Dude, how'd you know to wear a wingsuit?

Muscle Man: It was in the textbook, bro!

(Muscle Man, with Rigby on board, starts spinning in the air toward the mark.)

Johnny Crasher: Well, I'll be! He read the textbook!

Muscle Man: Alright, let me down easy!

(He goes down lower, and they start rolling down the path until they finally make their mark. They lift their head up, and two men show up smashing their back with pieces of wood.)

Johnny Crasher: The doctor said this eye would never produce tears again, but the way you hit those marks out there is nothing short of a miracle!

(He throws the stuntman licenses on them.)

Johnny Crasher: Congratulations! And, uh, this time I'm being sincere.

(Rigby and Muscle Man groan with happiness. We cut back to the party, where Benson is behind the "Happu Birthday Timmy!" sign.)

Benson: Everything ready, guys?

Muscle Man: Yeah.

Benson: Okay, kids, it's the moment you've all been waiting for!

Timmy: It's time for my birthday stunt!

Benson: Hit it!

(Mordecai plays a roll n roll track on the radio, and Rigby and Muscle Man, both completely bandaged up, come riding in through the sign on a bicycle.)

Muscle Man: Yeah! Whoo!

Rigby: Make some noi-oise!

(Timmy and the others are stunned.)

Rigby and Muscle Man: Happy brithday, Tim-

(As they go up the ramp, the bicycle falls through the confetti cake, sending them through it as well. Muscle Man start squealing in pain.)

Muscle Man: I'm sorry, Timmy.

(Rigby slides through the rest of the ramp.)

Timmy: Alright! That was the best stunt I've ever seen. Now, let's open some presents!

Rigby: Aw, I love that little guy.

Muscle Man: Hey, hear me out. All I'm saying is that it's hard to make a New Year's resolution when you're always bringing your "A" game.

Mordecai: Tch! Come on, you gotta have a resolution for new years.

Muscle Man: Hmm. I guess I can put in more time on my amazing muscles. I'll really get these kittens to purr next year.

Hi Five Ghost: I think I would like to learn a second language. What about you, Thomas?

Thomas: I'm going to try to help my mom more next year.

(Rigby blows raspberries in response)

Muscle Man: Not cool, bro. That resolution is legit.

Eileen: Here are your coffees, guys.

Rigby: Yo Eileen, you got a resolution?

Eileen: Well, I would like to work on my craft blog more, but I won't have time until we get a new waitress around here.

Man: (Off-screen) Can I get a refill?

Eileen: Later.

(Walks off)

Rigby: Ugh! Let's talk about real resolutions. This year is going to be the year of the Rigby. I'm keeping it all Rigby, all the time.

Mordecai: What does that even mean? Your'e just picking something vague so you can't fail at it.

Rigby: No, last year definitely didn't have enough Rigby. This year is gonna be Rigby crazy!

Mordecai: I don't know, last year felt pretty crazy.

Rigby: That's just cause Margaret dumped you.

Mordecai: Aw, dude! Come on!

Rigby: What? I'm just keeping it Rigby.

Muscle Man: So, you gonna turn around your lady luck this year?

Mordecai: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I am. This year, no more waiting to wuss out. If I see a cute girl, I'll just talk to her.

(The gang cheers)

Muscle Man: So, when are we meeting up for the New Year's Eve party?

Thomas: What New Year's Eve party?

Rigby: It's one of those parties where you wear masks and stuff.

Mordecai: A Masquerade?

Rigby: Yeah, whatever. Like I said, you wear masks.

(A door opens up, which reveals a girl with snake hair and her friends. She manages to catch Mordecai's eye.)

Muscle Man: Yo, bro. She's pretty smoking.

Mordecai: Yeah. Uh, I mean what?

Rigby: You should go talk to her, man.

(The gang complains)

Muscle Man: Come on, dude. Come on.

Mordecai: Uh, I don't really think--.

Everyone: Come on, dude!

Rigby: Come on, dude. You got this. No problem.

Mordecai: Yeah. All right. I got this.

(Everyone cheers Mordecai on while he walks up to Tracy. Mordecai talks to her and her friends and they start laughing while the gang tries to hear the conversation.)

Rigby: What are they saying?

Muscle Man: I don't know, bro. Be quiet.

Thomas: She's smiling a lot.

Hi Five Ghost: Shh! Shh! He's coming back. How did it go?

Mordecai: (Sighs) I got her digits!

(The gang cheers)

Thomas: So, are you gonna call her?

Mordecai: Yeah. I think I'll ask her to the New Year's party tomorrow.

Muscle Man: Nice.

Rigby: Looks like we need a round of victory coffees! But first, I need to empty the tank.

(Rigby flushes the toilet and starts washing his hands when a hologram appears that looks just like Rigby)

Future Rigby: R-R-Rigby!

Rigby: Ahh!

Future Rigby: Whoa, whoa, whoa! Chill, dude. It's just me, I mean you. Look, I'm you from the future.

Rigby: What the--? Were you in the stall the whole time?

Future Rigby: Gross! No! I got something to tell you. You have to help Mordecai. He's going to kiss a girl at New Years and you have to stop him.

Rigby: That sounds like the opposite of helping him. Are you really me from the future?

Future Rigby: Come on! You have to trust me!

Rigby: Oh, yeah? Prove it. If you're from the future, then what's my New Year's resolution?

Future Rigby: Year of the Rigby, baby!

Rigby: Whoa! You are me from the future!

Future Rigby: Yeah, I know.

Rigby: Okay, so what's the deal about this New Year's kiss again?

Future Rigby: Okay, so it's going to happen like this. Tomorrow at the New Year's mask party, Pops is going to open a bottle of sparkling apple juice too early, then Muscle Man is going to streak in a diaper, and then right after that, Mordecai is going to kiss a girl he shouldn't kiss. You gotta stop that kiss!

Rigby: Okay, but why?

Future Rigby: Sorry dude, future rules say I can't tell you. But--.

Future phone: Insert five credits to continue the hologramic call.

Future Rigby: Wait! Trust me! It's the only way he'll be happy!

(Future Rigby disappears)

Rigby: Uhhhhh...

(Back at the house, Rigby is having a nightmare about what his future self told him, which shows him running as a lot of clocks spin around until they hit midnight. He then falls onto the cork on the apple juice bottle as Pops is opening it up. It sends him flying, and he sees Muscle Man streaking as he passes by.)

Muscle Man: Happy New Year, bro! Whoo hoo!

(Then Mordecai shows up puckering up for a kiss. Rigby screams, then wakes up. He quickly grabs Tracy's phone number and flushes it down the toilet.)

(In the morning, Mordecai starts looking for Tracy's phone number)

Mordecai: Dude, have you seen that girl's phone number? I thought I put it on the nightstand, but I can't find it.

Rigby: Uh, what did it look like?

Mordecai: Like a bunch a numbers next to a girl's name.

Rigby: Oh, that phone number! Nope, haven't seen it.

(Mordecai looks at Rigby suspiciously)

Mordecai: Rigby, where's the number?

(He takes Rigby's magazine away)

Rigby: Look, you don't need to be mad, but I might have thown it away.

Mordecai: What?! What's wrong with you? Ugh!

Rigby: Hey, just calm down. My future self told me this is the right thing to do.

Mordecai: Oh, yeah; then where's this future self now?

Rigby: Uh, he had to go; he ran out of credits. Future credits.

Mordecai: Not cool, bro.

Rigby: Come on, we'll go to the party with a group like we planned. It'll be fun.

Mordecai: Alright. It's not like I'm going to see that number again, anyway.

(Mordecai's phone suddenly rings, and he answers)

Mordecai (continued): Hello? Oh, hey, Tracy. Yeah yeah, of course I remember you, from the coffee shop. No, no, I was totally gonna call you; I just didn't know if I had to wait like a day or two or two and a half. But, um, yeah, I was wondering if you wanted to, if you don't have plans, to go to this New Year's masquerade party tonight? With me, I mean. 

(Short pause, and Mordecai silently cheers as Rigby walks out of the room. Mordecai still continues to talk to Tracy.)

Mordecai (continued): Cool. So, should I pick you up?

(Rigby then goes downstairs and sees Muscle Man and High-Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Yo, Rigby; check it out. I'm gonna prank in the New Year right. I'm making these tear-away tuxedo pants, so I can streak at midnight.

(He tears off the pants)

Muscle Man (continued): Fives, time.

Hi Five Ghost: Point forty-five seconds.

Muscle Man: Still not fast enough.

Rigby:  (Makes a disgusted face) You're streaking at the New Year's party? (Gasps) Oh, no!

(Runs off)

Muscle Man: Whatever. Not everyone understands performance art.

(Rigby goes to Skips's house)

Rigby: Skips! I have to stop Mordecai from kissing this girl at midnight.

Skips: Why?

Rigby: Cause my future self appeared to me in the bathroom, and he told me all this stuff that's going to happen, and now it is happening, and all I know is it's really important!

Skips: Hmm. Well, it sounds like the wheels of fate are already in motion, so... you're probably gonna fail.

Rigby: What?! So, what do I do?

Skips: Time traveling gets really complicated, and my advice is to not overthink it. See you at the party.

Rigby: Aghhhhhh!

(At the party, Rigby starts talking to Benson)

Rigby (continued): Benson, have you seen Mordecai?

Benson: Yeah, he came in a while ago with his date. She seems pretty nice, yeah.

Rigby: No! Ahhhh!

(He runs into the party trying to find Mordecai)

Rigby (continued): Mordecai? Pops! Have you seen Mordecai?

Pops: Oh, Rigby; how did you know it was me? (Laughs) Oh, before I forget, make sure you get your sparkling apple juice.

(Rigby gasps as he remembers that Pops was going to open an apple juice bottle at the party)

Rigby: Oh, no! 

(Runs off)

(Scene changes to Mordecai and Tracy)

Tracy: So, you work and live at the park.

Mordecai: Yeah; it's pretty cool. Uh, hey, do you know what this party reminds me of?

Tracy: Uh, what?

Mordecai: Well you know that video game where you're spying that four anemasie, and you have to fight all the zombies?

Tracy: I wasn't allowed to play video games as a kid.

Mordecai: What? You gotta be kidding me. (Laughs) So, what are you into?

Tracy: Texting, some social media.

Mordecai: I'm gonna get us some punch.

(Mordecai leaves while Rigby comes in)

Rigby: Mordecai!

(He hides behind a pole as Tracy is seen talking on the phone)

Tracy: (On the phone) Ugh, this date is the worst. I thought he was eccentric, but he's just weird. The good news is when Tommy finds out I'm with another guy, he'll be so jealous. We're totally getting back together.

Rigby: Aw, future me totally called it.

(Mordecai returns with a cup of punch)

Mordecai: Here's your punch.

Rigby: (Rigby knocks down the punch) Dude, no!

Mordecai: Ugh! Rigby! what are you doing?

Rigby: You can't kiss that girl! She said you were "electric" and weird, and she's just using you to get back with Tommy!

Mordecai: That's it.

(Grabs Rigby)

Rigby: She's the wrong girl! You have to listen to me!

Mordecai: No, dude. will you quit messing with me? I think I have a chance at this.

Rigby: Aghhh! You can't do this! My future self told me this is important!

Mordecai: Oh, the future self you met in the bathroom? Right.

Rigby: No! (Grabs onto Mordecai's leg) Don't kiss her!

Mordecai: Get off of me!

(Mordecai shakes Rigby off of his leg, but Rigby tries to stop him. He finally ends up pushing Rigby into the bathroom.)

Rigby: No! Wait!

(Mordecai closes the bathroom door and shoves a chair under the knob so Rigby can't get out.)

Mordecai: I hope you enjoy spending the year of the Rigby alone.

(Rigby randomly pounds on the door and his future self appears)

Future Rigby: R-R-Rigby!

Rigby: Dude, why are you always showing up in the bathroom?

Future Rigby: (Shrugs) I just get better reception. Anyway, what are you doing in here? You're running out of time.

Rigby: Me? What are you doing in here? I could've used you out there when I was trying to convince Mordecai. He wouldn't believe me, and now it's almost midnight!

Future Rigby: Alright, alright, here's something to help you.

(Future Rigby sends his past self a stopwatch)

Future Rigby (continued): This stopwatch will slow down time for about sixty seconds. It will buy you some time to stop the kiss.

Rigby: Great, but how am I supposed to get outta here in time to use it?

(His future self points up to an air vent)

DJ: Alright, everybody, the ball is dropping on my watch, which means it's time to countdown for the New Year.

Rigby: (Rigby climbs up to the air vent) Uh, I guess I'll see you later?

Future Rigby: Not unless you screw up something royal.

(Future Rigby teleports away and Rigby gets inside the vent. He tries to find an exit while everyone is counting down to the New Year. Rigby finds the exit unsuspectingly and falls down. He then sees Mordecai and Tracy about to kiss and he uses the stopwatch, which slows down everything except for Rigby himself. Muscle Man is shown tearing up his clothes while in a diaper. Rigby starts running over to Mordecai and Tracy, but accidentally bumps into Pops, which makes him open his sparkling apple juice early. The juice gets on Benson and Skips, and the cork bounces and hits Muscle Man's eye, which makes him go on a rampage. Mordecai and Tracy are shown about to kiss once again.)

Rigby: Nooooooo! Huh?

(Rigby notices some people that Muscle Man knocked down are blocking his path and jumps on one of them and shoves "Mordecai" away from the kiss. The stopwatch breaks into pieces, and the time goes back to normal.)

DJ: Happy New Year!

(Everyone cheers and balloons fall down)

Rigby: Did I make it?

Tommy: (Who has Mordecai's hairstyle and color, and is wearing a mask that represents Mordecai's face) Get off me, punk!

Rigby: Huh?

Tracy: Oh, Tommy; are you okay?

Tommy: Tracy Hashtag, you're the best.

(Tracy and Tommy start kissing)

Rigby: Wait, what?

Mordecai: Hey.

Rigby: Mordecai!

Mordecai: So I figured out who Tommy was. You were right, dude. I should've listened to you. Sorry for locking you in the bathroom.

Rigby: So that means--? You didn't--? I did it! Whoo! Year of the Rigby!

Mordecai: (Bumps into a girl whose head represents a cloud) Oh, uh sorry.

CJ: No worries. Running to meet your date? I get it.

Mordecai: Actually, the date thing didn't plan out tonight.

CJ: Oh, I know how that goes.

(Mordecai and the girl laugh as they notice everyone kissing their dates)

CJ (continued): You know, while the clock isn't over yet, we can still make the best of this.

Mordecai: Huh?

(The girl kisses Mordecai. There is a short pause, and they kiss again.)

DJ: And let's greet the New Year with a fresh face. Everyone, take off your mask!

(Mordecai and the girl stop kissing to take off their masks. When the girl takes off her mask, Mordecai finds out that the girl is CJ; who he hasn't seen since "Yes Dude Yes")

(The both of each other both say each other's names)

Mordecai: CJ?

CJ: Mordecai?

Mordecai: Uh...?

Rigby: Aw, what?! So, does that mean--? Did I--? I gotta check the bathroom.

(Runs off)

Mordecai: CJ?

(Mordecai notices she's gone and we see her exiting the party. Mordecai sees her mask and picks it up, worrying about what's going to happen now. Then we see Muscle Man still streaking while being chased by cops.)

Muscle Man: Whooo! Happy New Year! Whoo hoo!

Muscle Man: And he was all like, BOOM!

(Muscle Man makes an explosion hand movement. Muscle Man, High-Five Ghost, and Thomas laugh.)

Benson: Hey! (eats a wing with sauce and laughs) Listen up, everybody, stop talking! (Benson shushes everybody while everybody lays their eyes on Benson.) Look, I just want to thank everybody for training so hard, we're doing a real good job. And I think we're in great shape for the dodgeball tournament tomorrow.

Muscle Man: I'll say. As long as Mordecai keeps throwing them spheres.

(Pretends to do the move he was talking about Mordecai doing.)

Mordecai: Ahhhhhhhhhh....... Nahhhhhh............

(Everybody Else): YEAHHHHH!!!!!!!!!

Thomas: Yeah, man, that spin move you were doing was crazy.

(Twirls his finger in a circle.)

Mordecai: Oh yeah, the Tornado.

Rigby: Yeah! The Tornado! Where'd you learn that? You were like WHAM! (Shows a movement of the Tornado.)

Hi Five Ghost: Ha ha. It is crazy fast.

Muscle Man: One of those Tornados flew by my head, and it was all like,(makes fast wind-swishing sounds. Everybody else laughs hard.) It's true.

Benson: Alright, everybody, just simmer down now. We've all been playing great, alright? (Everybody else chatters.) But, if I had to be totally honest here, we could all stand to learn a little something, from, this guy right here. (Touches Mordecai and whispers.) I think you're better than all of these guys here. (eats a wing and twirls his finger)

Mordecai: (chuckles) Thanks, man.

Skips: Hey, take it easy on those wings, Benson. You might still have a concussion from practice.

Benson: No, you're right, you're right. But you know what? I'm just gonna go ahead and say it. I think we have a really good shot of winning the tournament this year. (stands up) Sure we haven't won this thing in 10 years. But this is our year! Benson's Ballerz are gonna win this! So who's with me?!

Everyone else: Yeah!

Benson: I'm sorry, did you guys just say "Yeah?"

Everyone else: YEAH!

Benson: Alright, then! Let's do this!

(Scene cuts to the dodgeball arena, where people are training for the tournament. We pan over to Benson's Ballerz.)

Mordecai: Alright, dude. You figure out hoe to throw the right way this time?

Rigby: (holding a dodgeball) Hmm! Hmm! I got this! Rignado! (spins) Hee-yah! (throws the dodgeball, and it hits the referee)

Referee: Ooohhh! (falls)

Rigby: Oooohh!

Mordecai: Uhh, still needs work. (runs off)

Benson: (approaching Rigby) Rigby! No, no. No tornado.

(We see Mordecai picking up a dodgeball, when another flies into view.)

???: Hey! A little help?

(Mordecai picks up the other dodgeball and throws it back. It's revealed that CJ is the one who threw the ball, and is standing with wide open arms. Her smile fades as the two look at each other, and the dodgeball hits her. Mordecai screams.)

Mordecai: Ooooh! (turns around and runs off)

Thunder Girl Member: Hey, CJ! Come on!

(Mordecai continues running to the door as Rigby throws a ball at him.)

Rigby: You're out! (watches Mordecai run through the door. Mordecai sighs in the hallway) Dude, what's your deal?

Mordecai: CJ is here.

Rigby: Are you guys gonna make out and run away from each other again?

Mordecai: Dude, quit it! I haven't seen her since we kissed on New Year's Eve and I feel weird around her. Like she still hates me for the whole movie mix-up with Margaret.

Rigby: Then just go talk to her about it.

Mordecai: No! Ugh, man. I'm not gonna be able to focus with her here. What if she distracts me and I mess up?

Rigby: Dude, whatever. Her team is new. They'll probably get eliminated in like, 2 seconds.

Mordecai: Yeah, I guess I'll just try to avoid her.

Benson: (comes through the door) Come on, you two! The game's about to start. (smiles and points) Benson's Ballerz needs their star player.

(Cut to Mordecai on the dodgeball court. Benson's Ballerz is on the left side, while East Pines is on the right.)

Referee: Alright, dodgeballers! If you get hit, cross the center line, or an opposing player catches your ball, you're out! First place goes to the last team standing. On your mark, get set, dodgeball!

(Benson's Balllerz defeat East Pines and move on to the second round, along with Blitz Bombs who had defeated Last Picks. The Magical Elements are up against an unknown team, and the emerge victorious. Thanks to Thomas, Benson's Ballerz defeat Blitz Bombs and move on to the third round along with Death Kwon Dodge. CJ's team, The Thunder Girls, defeat the coffee team and make it to the semi-final. along with Duke Dodgers. Mordecai uses his Tornado technique to defeat Sensai of Death Kwon Dodge, allowing his team to move on to the semi-final, along with none other than the Magical Elements. As their team starts to lose players, Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Skips huddle up.)

Rigby: We don't stand a chance against these guys. They're using magic!

Benson: You're right. Line up behind Skips! (The Guardians of Eternal Youth have their magical dodgeballs ready) Skips, you gotta catch these. We got your back!

(The dodgeballs are thrown and Skips catches them as they turn red. Benson and Skips throw them, knocking out the God of Basketball and a wizard player. Mordecai knocks out Death, and soon, it's down to one Guardian and Gary.)

Benson: Finish this, Mordecai!

(Mordecai is about to throw, when...)

CJ: (to her teamates) ...and then I was like, "No, its cause we want that huge trophy! (laughs with the team)

(Gary throws the ball at Mordecai face, eliminating him.)

Benson: NOOOO!

Gary: Well, Benson, looks like your star player just burnt out. (makes a hissing sound)

(Benson, in a fit of rage, juimps and throws the ball directly at Gary's face.)

Benson: Yeah! (gets knocked out by Reginald)

Rigby:  (catches the dodgeball) Hey, I caught it!

(Reginald throws another ball, knocking out Skips but missing Rigby, who is now the only one left.)

Benson: No. No. No!

(Rigby trembles while Reggie laughs)

Reginald: Well, let's get this over with.

(In slow motion, Rigby uses his Rignado and knock out the remaining Guardian.)

Referee: You're out!

Reginald: Nooooo! (uses magic on the audience, who run aside.)

Ballerz: OOOOOOOHHHH! (run to Rigby)

Benson: I'm sorry I doubted you, man. (to Mordecai) Mordecai, what happened out there?

Mordecai: Uhh....

Rigby: This girl that hates Mordecai is here and it's messin' up his game. (gets punched by Mordecai)

Benson: (not surprised) Mordecai, why didn't you say so?

Mordecai: It's complicated, okay?

Hi Five Ghost: (goes to the team bracket) Hey, we're playing the girls in the final game: The Thunder Girls

(We are shown Benson's Ballerz vs The Thunder Girls in the final.)

Mordecai: What?! (watches the team go on the court) Aaaugh! We're playing CJ's team? (puts his head in his hands) Aw, man. I can't do this. I can't do this!

Benson: (walks up tto Mordecai) Hey, hey. The only thing we can't do is lose! We already beat The Magical Elements! We've come too far to back down now. TOO FAR!

(Cut to the final game underway.)

Referee: On your mark get set, dodgeball!

(The two teams grab their dodgeballs and start throwing. One by one, each team member starts getting eliminated.)

Benson: (on sidelines with Fives, Muscle Man, Thomas, Pops and Skips) Ugh! We're dropping like flies!

Thunder Girl Member #2: Ugh! They're crushing us!

(Mordecai and CJ are the only players left. They both have worried looks on their faces.)

Benson: What is he doing?!

(Mordecai makes the first throw, which CJ dodges. She makes her throw, and Mordecai dodges as well. They both frantically start grabbing and throwing dodgeeballs and each other and dodging.)

Benson: Aaah! I can't take this! Finish her, Mordecai! Finish her so we can win this!

(Mordecai looks back at CJ.)

Benson: (in slow motion and rage) Finish her!

Thunder Girls: (in slow motion) Finish him!

(Mordecai starts running up with a dodgeball, and CJ does the same. They both spin and throw their dodgeballs at each other, and they both colide with great force and richochet back at the respective dodgeballers, causing them to disappear in midair. The scene moves to a dark area, where Mordecai and CJ reappear and plunder. They both get up and find themselves in a dark realm, where 5 people are looking at them.)

CJ: What is this place?

(They watch a replay of themselves in the final round.)

IDC #1: Mordecai and CJ, you have been summoned before the IDC.

Mordecai: The what?

IDC #2: The Intergalactic Dodgeball Councl, duh!

IDC #3: The reason that you're here is because you've reached an infinite standoff. And we believe that you're unable to knock each out because you've avoiding your history together.

CJ: What?! We're not avoiding our history together. (at Mordecai) I mean, like...

Mordecai: Yeah. We don't even have a history together. Well, you know what I mean, right?

CJ: (nods) Oh, yeah. We don't even...have a history...together.

IDC #4: You're dodging the facts.

IDC #2: Yes. Why are you dodging?

(Mordecai and CJ look at each other.)

IDC #3: Let us then view a replay of your history together.

(He forms three magic balls and floats them up. The first one is shown with a scene from Yes Dude Yes.)

CJ: (in scene) Oh, gross. How old are you? (she and Mordecai laugh)

(A second scene from Yes Dude Yes is shown.)

Mordecai: (in scene) But it's true!

CJ: (in scene) I can't believe this! Are you just playing? (turns into a cloud) Is this a game to you?!

CJ: (at IDC) Oh, that history.

(Mordecai looks up at the final scene.)

CJ: (in scene) We can still make the best of this.

Mordecai: (in scene) Huh? (they kiss)

(CJ buries her head with a regretful look.

Mordecai: Alright, look. (sighs) Every time I see CJ, I mess up. I didn't mean to lead her on with the date, or the kiss, but I did. And I understand why she's mad at me.

CJ: Wait. I'm not mad at you, Mordecai. I was just embarrassed because of the way I took off after the kiss. I honestly thought you were mad at me.

Mordecai: Really?

(The second IDC member looks at them thoughtly.)

CJ: I'm definitely not mad at you.

Mordecai: Man. Sometimes I feel so dumb about this kind of stuff.

CJ: (laughs) Yeah, me too.

Mordecai: Well, you wanna start over, as friends?

CJ: Yeah! I'd love to. You know, like, as friends.

IDC #2: But what about the kiss?! The kiss! Oh, come on. Did that not mean anything?!

(Mordecai and CJ chuckle nervously.)

CJ: If I'd have known who he was, then I..

Mordecai: Yeah, I would've never, you know...

CJ: Oh, no. Totally. Never.

IDC #3: All in favor of Mordecai and CJ resuming league play?

(The IDC members start raising their spheres.)

IDC #2: Ugh! (raises sphere) Fine! But you still have to try to get each other out.

(Mordecai and CJ look at each other with a smile)

IDC #3: Then the matter is settled. You are free to resume league play.

(The IDC throw their spheres at Mordecai and CJ, who scream. They reappear back on the dodgeball court.)

Benson: (in slow motion and rage) Finish her!

Thunder Girls: (in slow motion) Finish him!

(CJ winks at Mordecai, who smiles)

Mordecai: You go.

CJ: No, you go.

Mordecai: No, you go.

CJ: Ok. (throws dodgeball at Mordecai's face, which hits him in slow motion)

Mordecai: Aaaargh! (falls back)

Referee: (blows whistle) The Thunder Girls win!

(The Thunder Girls run on the court and cheer.)

Thunder Girls: Thunder Girls! Thunder Girls!

(Benson falls to his knees and bawls,)

Benson: Noooooooo! This was the Balllerz's year! The Ballerz's year!

(Mordecai walks up to CJ and her team.)

Mordecai: Hey, good game.

CJ: You too.

Mordecai: Uh, I'm glad we're friends.

CJ: Yeah, I'm glad too. (starts to hi-five Mordecai, but quickly pulls her hand away with a smile) I'm glad that I whooped your butt! Oooooohhh!

Mordecai: (scoffs) Yeah, that was pretty good. Pretty good.

(Benson is crouched on the ground, sobbing.)

Skips: There's always next year, Benson.

Benson: I need a wing real bad.

Eileen: Alright, Rigby. Would you rather...comb your hair with a hot dog, or have feet for hands?

Rigby: Pfft! Feet for hands! Run twice as fast!

Mordecai: But how would you play video games?

Rigby: (Gets up in Mordecai's face) Feet for hands!

CJ: Your turn, Mordecai. Would you rather...live on a houseboat made of garbage, or eat a sandwich in a portable toilet?

Mordecai: Portable toilet.

CJ: You'd really do that?

Mordecai: (Scoffs) Over a garbage houseboat, obviously. It'd smell bad, and then the water would make it smell more, and then you just got a big pile of wet garbage.

CJ: So you're saying you would eat a sandwich in a portable toilet?

Mordecai: (Points at CJ) Yes.

CJ: Huh. (Pulls a wrapped sandwich out of her bag) Just so happens I got my sandwich right here. (Gasps and points) And what's that over there?

(Mordecai looks over his shoulder to see a portable toilet behind him)

Rigby: Ooh! (Slams his hand on the table) Time to put your sandwich where your mouth is!

Mordecai: You can't be serious.

CJ: What a coincidence, my sandwich is chicken, too.

(Rigby and Eileen shout out an amused 'Ooooh!' in behalf of CJ's playful banter. Mordecai seems to inwardly groan in disbelief as CJ slides her sandwich over to him.)

Eileen: She's got you there, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Are you daring me? (He puts up his hands) 'Cause if you're gonna dare me, just dare me.

CJ: (Shrugs) Alright, I dare you.

Mordecai: Oh, so we're just changing games now. Fine, then.

(He gets up from the table and begins to walk over to the portable toilet, CJ's sandwich in hand)

CJ: (Holds out her hand) Wait!

(Mordecai turns around)

CJ (continued): How will we know if you actually do it?

Eileen: (Who stands up from her spot at the table) Right, it's not a legitimate dare without a credible witness.

(Rigby quickly jumps up from his seat)

Rigby: Fine. I'll be the incredible witness! 

(He begins to walk away. Eileen sits back down, and CJ grabs a water bottle out of her bag.)

Eileen: (Turns to CJ) So.... were you planning that the whole time, or...

(CJ twists the cap off of her water bottle as Eileen says this)

CJ: Nah. It was more of an impulse.

(She takes a sip of her water. Meanwhile, Rigby is seen opening the door to the portable toilet, and he and Mordecai step inside. Rigby closes the door behind them and switches the sign from vacant to occupied.) 

Mordecai: (Looking around) Huh. I gotta say, this is pretty classy.

Rigby: I guess if I needed to go outside I'd do it here. So you're really going through with this?

(As Rigby continues speaking, Mordecai sits down on the toilet)

Rigby (continued): I can just vouch for you, ya know. It's no big deal.

Mordecai: (While eating the sandwich) I'm a man of my word. (Chewing) So, CJ and Eileen seem to be getting along.

Rigby: Yeah, I guess.

(He pulls himself up so that he can look out the window. He sees CJ and Eileen talking over at the picnic table and decides to make a mockery of their conversation.)

Rigby (continued): (In a lame impression of Eileen's voice) Boy, we have so much in common. Would you rather... awkwardly kiss Mordecai on New Year's Eve, or dare him to eat a sandwich in a portable toilet? Oh wow, both?!  (He turns around to see Mordecai has finished the sandwich. He immediately goes back to using his normal voice.) Oh, you're done. 

(Mordecai swallows the last of the sandwich)

Mordecai: Easy peasy no big deezy!

(He blows into the plastic bag that held CJ's sandwich and pops it. Rigby hops down from his spot at the window.)

Rigby: Great, let's get out of here.

(He goes to open the door when he realizes that the handle is stuck)

Rigby (continued): (Turns to Mordecai) It's stuck.

Mordecai: Dude, that's not funny.

Rigby: Why would I joke about this; you know how I am with small spaces!

(He begins to panic and furiously jiggles the door handle)

Mordecai: Come on, dude. Try and calm down.

(Rigby stops trying to open the door)

Rigby: (Puts a hand to his head) Okay, I'm trying. Caaaaaaalm.

Mordecai: Good. CJ and Eileen are right out there. They'll come and get us any minute.

(The camera shows Rigby with a blank expression on his face)

Mordecai (continued): Right? Uh.... Rigby?

(Mordecai waves his hand in front of Rigby's face)

Mordecai (continued): Rigby?!

(Rigby immediately begins to act hysterical)

Rigby: (Screaming) We're gonna starve before they find us! Why'd you eat the whole sandwich? You should've saved some just in case!!

Mordecai: Dude, that makes no sense!

Rigby: (Points at Mordecai) You makes no sense!

(He begins to screech and pound on the door violently, to which Mordecai just rolls his eyes)

Rigby (continued): Help! I'm trapped in here with a crazy person!

(The camera shows the portable toilet rocking back and forth as Rigby hits it, his screams audible to anyone nearby. Meanwhile, CJ and Eileen are engrossed in a deep conversation.)

Eileen: I think the character I love to hate the most is King Harry. He's such a pill.

(Both girls look up as they hear a loud noise)

CJ: Huh?

(Rigby continues to pound on the door violently, and the girls walk over to the portable toilet)

CJ: Hey guys! How's it going in there?

Mordecai: Well, things are going fine. The sandwich is done. But, uh, now it's kinda...

Rigby: The door is stuck. Get us out of here!

CJ: (Sarcastically) Oh, that's terrible.

(CJ and Eileen snicker)

CJ: Do you need some...oh, what is the word I'm looking for?

Eileen: It's on the tip of my tongue. Help?

CJ: Oh, yeah...help or something?

Rigby: Yes! Could you please help us?

CJ: I guess we could try.

(CJ attempts to open the door. She pulls on the door's handle, but it refuses to open.)

CJ: Oh. It really is stuck.

(Rigby begins to scream again)

Eileen: I knew I should've brought my keysmith multi-tool today. Never doubt your gut, Eileen.

Mordecai: There's some tools in the garage.

CJ: All right. Hold tight. Don't run out of oxygen in there!

(The girls laugh and begin to walk away)

Eileen: I get that you're joking, but actually, portable toilets are quite well-ventilated.

Mordecai: This thing is brand-new. How did the handle get stuck like... wha...oh!

(Mordecai pulls his hand back, revealing some kind of a brown sauce sticking to his fingers)

Mordecai (continuned): What is this stuff?

Rigby: That's meatball gravy.

Mordecai: How did meatball gravy get on the doorknob, Rigby?

Rigby: I was eating meatballs!

Mordecai: You're not supposed to eat meatballs with your hands, dude.

Rigby: Hands are nature's forks!

Mordecai: Try the window or something.

(Rigby jumps up to the window)

Rigby: I can't even get my fingers through the holes. They're like tiny prison bars.

Mordecai: All right. Option two: let's ram the door.

(Mordecai and Rigby ram the door, which leads to them knocking over the portable toilet that they're in. A flowerpot hits Mordecai on the head and knocks him out. )

(Muscle Man and High Five Ghost are walking in The Park)

Muscle Man: So, what are you doing tonight?

High Five Ghost: I got to house-sit my cousin's dog. What about you?

Muscle Man: That on-target 1.2 combination model's been singing my name all week.

High Five Ghost: Oh. They finally installed that new outhouse?

Muscle Man: Show some respect, bro. It's called a "portable toilet".

High Five Ghost: Okay. Well, that sounds like fun. Have a good weekend.

Muscle Man: Oh, I will, bro. I will. I'm yours now, baby.

(Muscle Man sees the portable toilet knocked over)

Muscle Man: What?! No! This is not okay.

(Muscle Man pulls out his cellphone and dials a number)

Muscle Man: Yeah. It's Muscle Man. We got a code sixty seven over here.

(A helicopter comes in and replaces the knocked down portable toilet with a new one)

Muscle Man: Make sure she gets a good home!

Helicopter Pilot: She will! Decommissioned units get sent to the military for target practice.

Muscle Man: That's so honorable!

(The helicopter flies off with the old portable toilet. Muscle Man now goes into the new portable toilet.)

(Later, Eileen and CJ show up at the portable toilet. Eileen pulls out a hammer from the tool box and begins to bang it against the door's handle.)

Eileen: Alright...first, we'll test the...

(The door opens, revealing Muscle Man to be in the portable toilet. He is wearing a bathrobe and is surrounded by candles. Relaxing music is heard playing in the background.)

Muscle Man: Eileen! Uh... Second girl. This is not awkward.

Eileen: Okay...

Muscle Man: I said it's not awkward! (Sighs) Listen, ladies, I know this model was voted throne of the year by Flush Twice Quarterly, but you're gonna have to wait your turn.

CJ: Mordecai and Rigby were locked in here. Do you know where they went?

Muscle Man: Uh... Okay. Yep. Well...this is awkward.

(A clock transition shows the helicopter flying away with the portable toilet. We cut to the inside of the portable toilet, where Mordecai and Rigby are lying unconscious. Rigby's phone then begins to ring, causing him to wake up and answer it.)

Rigby: (Groggily) Hello?

(CJ is heard responding on the other end)

CJ: Where are you guys?

Rigby: Let me check.

(He glances out of the window and begins to scream hysterically. The camera then switches over to CJ, who backs away from the phone after hearing Rigby screech like a banshee. Eileen quietly listens in on the conversation.)

CJ: Try and sit tight. Muscle Man is dealing with it. (Quizzically) He says he knows a guy?

(CJ and Eileen turn to look at Muscle Man, who is pacing around in front of the new portable toilet. He is on his phone trying to get ahold of somebody, but to no avail.)

Muscle Man: (Annoyed) Weak, I got the automated system.

(He starts pacing again as the electronic voice begins speaking)

Automated System: For toilet replacement, press one.

Muscle Man: (Firmly) No. Undo replacement!

(He continues to pace around angrily)

Automated System: You have selected toilet replacement.

Muscle Man: (Who is even angrier than before) NO!!

(He throws his free arm up in exasperation and indignantly shakes it at the sky)

Automated System: This is your second replacement today.

Muscle Man: (Heatedly) Put me through to the MILITARY!

Automated System: Thank you for calling On-Target. Goodbye.

(A hang up sound is heard. Muscle Man throws his arms up, officially defeated.)

Muscle Man: Aaaaaaah! Ah!

(He punches the new portable toilet in frustration. He then turns to look over at the girls.)

Muscle Man (continued): It didn't work. 

CJ: (On the phone) Where are you now?

(The camera switches back over to Mordecai and Rigby in the portable toilet. Mordecai is still unconscious, while Rigby is patiently awaiting CJ's question.)

Rigby: Uh... (He crawls over to the window and nervously peers outside) Uh....

(He sees a bunch of craters in the ground below)

Rigby: It looks like the moon! (Turns away dramatically) A horrifying moon of death! Do you know where that is?

(The camera switches back over to CJ, who appears to be extremely confused)

CJ: What?

(The camera immediately switches back over to Rigby)

Rigby: Hold on a second.

(A loud sound is heard, and the portable toilet shakes along with it. Mordecai finally wakes up, albeit in a very disoriented manner.)

Mordecai: Huh? Whaaa? (He sits up) What's happening?

(All of a sudden, the portable toilet is flipped right-side up. Mordecai and Rigby cry out in surprise as they plummet to the bottom of the structure. The camera then switches back over to CJ, who is looking at her phone in concern. Eileen rushes over to see what's the matter.)

CJ: Are you guys alright?

(Mordecai and Rigby are finally able to stand)

Mordecai: I think we're landing!

Rigby: It looks like...(Toilet lands among other toilets) a State Fair.

Mordecai: What? (On the phone) No, dude! It's a military base!

Rigby: (On the phone) How should I know? I've never been to a military base!

Mordecai: (On the phone) You've never been to a State Fair, either.

Muscle Man: Uh-oh. Okay, ladies. Now don't go whacko on me, but sometimes, the military uses decommissioned toilets for target practice.

CJ and Eileen: What?!

(The camera quickly switches back over to the military base. It zooms in on a sign that says 'keep out', and then proceeds to pan overtop all of the portable toilets. A covert building is then shown sitting atop a hill. The camera then reveals the inside of the building, which shows a man furiously typing away on a keyboard. Someone else is heard talking on the phone, as well.)

General: Mmm...mmm, yes. Mhm, agreed. 

(As the general is talking, the camera switches over to another man, who is viewing footage of the portable toilets. It then switches back over to the man who was first seen typing on his computer. He appears to be staring intently at a screen, as well. The camera finally reveals the general, who has his back turned as he continues to speak on the phone.)

General: (continued): Will do, sir.

(He hangs up the phone)

General (continued): Begin test phase of the F29 disintegrator laser system.

(One of the corporals swivels in his seat)

Corporal: Permission to speak freely, sir?

General: No.

(He turns towards the other corporal, who shifts in his seat as well)

Corporal #2: Permission to speak freely, sir?

General: Granted.

Corporal #2: Sir, why do we test the satellite laser on portable toilets, sir?

General: (Turns to face the corporal) Why do we test on portable toilets? (He walks over to the corporal) We need to be able to stop the enemies at a moment's notice. Enemies and portable toilets have two things in common: they're both soulless- (He gets up in the corporal's face)-and they're about the same size.

Corporal #2: Can never be too safe, sir.

General: You better believe it. (Begins walking away) Now I do not feel like being intimidated today, so let's put some taxpayer money to good use! Begin laser sequence!

(Multiple buttons are pressed and switches are flipped. A lever is raised up, causing the satelite laser to power up. General and Coperal #2 insert keys into the sockets.)

General: 3...2...1. Let's drop a laser-guided number two on this duke bucket.

(They turn the keys, and the satelite laser shines down on one of the portable toilets. It then shoots a laser at the toilet, obliterating it. Mordecai and Rigby witness this, and a shock wave rushes at them.)

Rigby: (On walkie talkie) Hurry up and help us!

(The shock wave passes through a tower)

Mordecai: You guys gotta come quick! We're gonna die!

(Line cuts from the phone, causing them to lose the girls)

CJ: We lost them!

(A helicopter arrives and places a portable toilet near the other one)

Eileen: I'll try and flag them down!

(She grabs flags from her toolbox and stands on top of one of the portable toilets to signal the pilot, who is reading a book and talking. She hops down from the portable toilet.)

CJ: What's wrong?

Eileen: My signals aren't working!

CJ: No! Now what we do? (Furious) This is terrible!

Eileen: Try and keep calm.

CJ: Keep calm?! Things finally stopped being weird with Mordecai, and now he's gonna get killed, (Turns dark) and it's all because of some stupid dare which wasn't even clever.

Eileen: CJ!

(Sees the first portable toilet being grabbed by the helicopter's claw)

Eileen (continued): Do you trust me?

CJ: Yeah.

Eileen: Would you rather: let Mordecai and Rigby get killed, or jump into that portable toilet and rescue them?

(CJ takes a deep breath, causing her to return to her normal color)

CJ: That's easy.

(They run into the portable toilet before it is carried away. Back at the military base, Rigby is trying to open the portable toilet's door.)

Rigby: I've been trying to open this for so long, I can't feel my arms. (Mockingly) Thank you, Mordecai!

Mordecai: Hey, you didn't have to close the door.

Rigby: Don't put this on me, man! I'm not the one who flirts by taking toilet dares!

Mordecai:  (shoves Rigby) Quiet!

(The two start fighting. We pan over to the helicopter taking the portable toilet. It lowers it to the ground, and Eileen and CJ run out, panting.)

General: Continue testing.

Corporal: (Looking through the screen) Oh, no. (To General) Uh, permission to speak freely, sir?

General: No.

Corporal #2: Permission to speak freely, sir?

General: Granted.

Corporal #2: Didn't the president say to limit testing because each blast costs three billion dollars?

General: The president's not my father! I'll blow up as many toilets as I like! Now, continue testing!

(Corporal #2 nods and raises the lever. Cut back to the girls.)

CJ: How much time do we have?

(Laser blasts toilet behind them)

Eileen: Uh...None!

(They jump out of the way)

CJ: They gotta be here somewhere. Come on!

(They start running)

Eileen: We need to split up!

(They do so)

CJ: Mordecai! Rigby!

(A toilet is blasted as she runs by. Cut to Eileen, who sees a rattling portable toilet. She opens it, but a random man runs out.)

Man: Thanks, lady!

(Eileen and CJ meet up again)

Eileen: Any luck?

CJ: No.

(Rigby appears through a toilet behind them, and they smile)

Rigby: We're right here!

(Mordecai and Rigby pound their bodies against the door. CJ and Eileen pull from the outside.)

Eileen: It's still stuck!

CJ: Get the tools.

General: Initiate humongous explosion signal.

(Multiple buttons are pressed and switches are flipped. Eileen grabs a crowbar from the toolbox and sticks it through the protable toilet door. CJ and Eileen pull. A corporal smashes the glass to the "Humongous Explosion Primer" lever and moves it down. The laser satellite starts spinning.)

Mordecai: We have to do it together!

General: On my mark.

Mordecai/General: 3...2...1!

(CJ and Eileen pull the door open. Mordecai and Rigby come out just as the satellite shines down on the toilet.)

Mordecai: Run!

(They run as the satellite blasts the portable toilet. There is a bright explosion. We are then shown Mordecai, Rigby, Eileen and CJ wrapped up in blankets.)

General: What were you kids thinking? You're lucky we saw your heat signatures so we could distinguish you from the debris.

Corporal #2: Sir, the president's on the line.

General: Urgggh! (Takes phone) Hello?

Mordecai: Thanks for getting us out of there, guys.

CJ: Couldn't have done it without you.

Eileen: Yeah. You guys were hitting that door pretty hard. CJ jumped into a moving helicopter.

Mordecai: Wow. Really?

CJ: Well, you know, more like a portable toilet being carried by a helicopter.

Eileen: Ain't no biggie.

CJ: We're not the ones getting stuck in portable toilets.

Mordecai: (Chuckles) Whatever. It was your bet.

CJ: Hey, Eileen, would you rather: sit here and be boring, or go play with that space laser?

CJ and Eileen: (Who lean in towards each other) Space laser!

(They walk over to the two corporals)

CJ: Hey, can we try this thing out?

Corporal: Well, I don't see why not.

Rigby: Wow. CJ's pretty cool.

Mordecai: Hah. Yeah. She is.

Hi Five Ghost: Can I get a half caff Americano please?

Girl: (To Fives) Good choice. I mean, I'm no coffee expert, but I gotta say; I think this place has the best Dark Roast in town.

(Takes a sip of coffee)

Hi Five Ghost: No arguments here. This is one of my favorite coffee spots.

Girl: Yeah, I love stopping here and then going to the record shop down the street.

Hi Five Ghost: I know the one! The owner's super chill and they have a huge "Down-Tempo Electronica" section.

Girl: Wait, you like "Down-Tempo Electronica"? Me too!

Hi Five Ghost: Wow! Cool!

Girl: (Offering to shake hands) I'm Celia, by the way.

Hi Five Ghost: (Shakes hands with Celia) Hi Five Ghost.

Celia: Um, do you maybe wanna head over there with me after a coffee?

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, sure.

(Cut to the City Record Shop)

Celia: Everyone says the Photon's Forming is Stereo Fighters' best album, but Tripdic Lullaby is my favorite.

Hi Five Ghost: Me too!

(Both laugh. Cut to the aquarium.)

Celia: Whoa, this is so cool.

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah, there's something about watching animals that makes me feel really peaceful.

Celia: Yeah... me too.

(Cut to Wing Kingdom)

Celia: Whoa! This is like the worst thing I've ever tasted.

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah! Me too!

(Cut back to the Cafe)

Hi Five Ghost (continued): Today was really fun! I never met anyone I had so much in common with.

Celia: Me too! I mean, me either.

Hi Five Ghost: (Blushing) Umm...do you wanna hang out again sometime?

Celia: Ye-ah! (Realizes something) Oh, well, I'd really like to, but I'm leaving the country tomorrow. I'm going to be studying in Prague. I'd give you my number, but I don't have a cellphone.

Hi Five Ghost: Hey, me too!

(They both sadden)

Celia: (Notices a stack of postcards, picks one up) I have an idea. In four years, when I'm back in the states, I'll send this postcard to you. If we're both single, we'll meet up and pick up where we left off. How's that?

Hi Five Ghost: That seems like the most logical way to stay in touch.

Celia: (Gives the postcard to Fives) Here, write your address.

(He does so)

Hi Five Ghost: I hope I see you in four years.

Celia: Me too.

(they both hold hands. We are then shown the 'present' day. Fives, along with Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Thomas are at the Snack Bar. Benson comes over to them)

Benson: Mordecai! Rigby! Another issue of Fart Weekly Magazine came today, which I distinctly remember telling you not to get sent here. They're flooding the mailbox!

Rigby: Relax, man. It's natural.

Mordecai: Rigby's right. It's not healthy to hold it in.

Benson: (sighs) Just cancel it already!

Muscle Man: Yo, is my tax return in there?

Benson: No, but Fives, this came for you. (Fives takes the busted card) Now, all of you, stop eating donuts and get back to work! (walks away)

Hi Five Ghost: (reading the card) "Let's meet..." (suddenly gasps)

Muscle Man: What is it?

Hi Five Ghost: It's the postcard from Celia!

Muscle Man: Whoa!

Mordecai: Who's Celia?

Hi Five Ghost: Only the coolest girl I ever met! Four years ago we made a promise to meet when she was done with school in Prague, and now she's back!

Muscle Man: Nice bro, nice.

Mordecai: Yeah, that's really awesome.

Rigby: So when are you gonna see her?

Hi Five Ghost: Oh, uhh, (takes a look at the postcard) uhh...uhh...wait! I don't know! I can't read anything else on the card! It's too busted up! What am I gonna do?!

Muscle Man: Whoa, bro. Don't worry. We just need to take a better look. Let's take it inside.

Hi Five Ghost: Uhh...uhh...okay, yeah.

(cut to the guys at Pops's House)

Muscle Man: Uhh...okay. So, how about...(tries looking at different angles of the postcard) I got nothing.

Rigby: Dude, what happened to it? It looks like it was in someone's mouth.

Mordecai: (takes the postcard) I don't know. I can't tell with all these change of address stamps.

Hi Five Ghost: Oh, yeah. I moved around a lot. It probably got stuck in the postal system for a while.

(Mordecai gives the postcard to Rigby.)

Rigby: Well, I think the first part is: "Dear...Dear Hi Five Ghost"?

Mordecai: Uh, yeah. I think we got that part.

Rigby: "I'm something something, something somethiiiiing you! Best wishes, Celia."

Muscle Man: Ugh! Thanks for getting us nowhere.

Mordecai: Here. (Rigby gives the postcard back to Mordecai.) Let me try to flatten it out. (flattens the postcard on the table and flips it over.) Hey, there's more writing! (everyone comes over to see) "Let's meet between 6 & 7pm on March 20th."

Hi Five Ghost: March 20?

(He checks his watch. The time is 21 to 4pm, and the day is, of course, March 20. He gasps and look at the calender. The first 19 days of the month have been crossed off, marking today the 20th. )

Man: (on TV) It's gonna be an awesome March 20! This March 20 get double thumbs up all the way baby! Wooo! It's March 20!

Mordecai: Turn off the TV!

Rigby; Oh, sorry. (turns off TV.)

Hi Five Ghost: Today is March 20!

Mordecai: I hate to say it, (holds up postcard) but we might not be able to figure this out.

HI Five Ghost: Then I'll just have to find someone who can.

(Cut to the City police station. Love Five Ghost leads the guys and his brother down the hallways.)

Low Five Ghost: These are some of the best forensic guys I know. If they can't decipher the letter, no one can.

Hi Five Ghost: I really appreciate you help me out.

Low Five Ghost: Don't thank me yet. While they're the best forensic guys I know, they're also the best chop-busting guys I know. If you want their help, you're gonna have to chop-bust 'em right back. (enters a room with two men) Hey, Wes! Westley!

Wes: Hey yo!

Westley: Low Fives! Gimme six! (laughs) Just bustin' your chops!

Low Five Ghost: (nodding) You guys...

Wes: So, Low, what's with all the clowns? (chuckles) Is the circus in town or something?! (he and Westley laugh) Just busting your chops.

Low Five Ghost: Ah, this is my brother Hi Five and his friends. They need your help readiing letters on a postcard.

Westley: Need help reading, huh?

Wes and Westley: You boys try opening your eyes?! Eh! (chuckle) Just busting your chop! Eh! Eh! Eh! (chuckle again)

Mordecai: Well, we can't read it 'cause the card's all busted up.

Wes: Oh, it's the card that's all busted up, huh? Are you sure it's not your face?!

Mordecai: (pointing at Wes) That's pretty big talk coming from someone that looks like you!

Rigby: Yeah! Did your mom dress you this morning?

Westley: Sorry, shortstuff, but you must be at least (puts his hand somewhere shorter than Rigby) this tall to enter the conversation! (he and Wes laugh and give each other multiple hi fives. Rigby snarls.)

Muscle Man: Alright, not bad. Hey Wes, how'd you grow a moustache on your butt? Oh, wait, that's your face! Ehhhh!

Wes: Well, since you're looking out for me, I gotta tell ya, that you should that lawn mower you've been lettin' cut your hair!

(Short silence)

Hi Five Ghost: You two just bust chops on guys who have no power so they're invulnerable to your chop-busting. But really you're just a couple of disc jockeys who haven't seen any real action since you left the academy. (Wes and Westley are shocked.) Hahaha, just bustin' your chops!

Wes: (suddenly stands up) You've gone too far!

Westley: You can't talk to an officer like that!

Hi Five Ghost: I mean...I... I thought...

Westley: Get on the ground, dirt bag!

(Hi Five Ghost lies face down on the floor.)

Hi Five Ghost: Sorry, sorry! (looks up) Uh, is this okay, or-

Wes: Did we say you could move?!

Hi Five Ghost: Oh no, sir! Sorry, sir!

Wes: Put your hands where I can see 'em!

(Hi Five Ghost reveals his arms. Wes and Westley look at each other. They chuckle again.)

Wes and Westley: Just bustin' your chops!

(Hi Five Ghost starts chuckling, followed by Rigby and Muscle Man. He floats back up.)

Hi Five Ghost: Alright, you got me.

Wes: You guys can bust chops with the best of 'em. So, let's see that letter. 

(Wes takes the letter, and he and Westley proceed with the analysation process. They receive a printed piece of paper from the machine.)

Hi Five Ghost: What does it say? Where am I supposed to meet her?

Westley: I hate to tell you kid, but that's the one thing we can't make out. (hands the paper to Hi Five Ghost, who starts reading it.)

HI Five Ghost: "Dear Hi Five Ghost, I hope you remember our promise we made four years ago. I back in the states and would love to see you. If you're still single, let meet at  <blank> Brick Oven Pizza <blank> on <blank>. If you don't show, I'l assume you've found someone else"? "Best wishes, Celia". (drops the paper) Oh, no! If I don't show up tonight she'll think I'm not interested! (grabs Muscle Man) I'll never see her again!

Muscle Man: Keep it together, bro! (to Wes and Westley) Come on, man. There's gotta be something else you can do.

Westley: There are a few more tests we could run, but they'll take some time.

Hi Five Ghost: Time? I don't have time! (seeing the clock) It's almost six o' clock!

Low Five Ghost: Cool it, little bro! Look, Brick Oven Pizza's a chain and there are only a few in the area. We'll start checking them while Wes and Westley run the tests. One way or another, we're gonna find her.

Mordecai: You can do it.

Rigby: Yeah, man. We'll help you.

Hi Five Ghost: Thanks, guys.

Low Five Ghost: Alright, let's roll!

(The search starts off with Rigby marking the chain restrarants of Brick Oven Pizza on a map. Low Five Ghost, his brother and the guys drive off in his cop car. Rigby directs Low Fives to the first chain, simply called Brick Oven Pizza. Hi Fives goes to check, but Celia is not there. Disappointed, he goes back to the car. A call call comes through the walkie talkie from Wes, telling them Westley worked through the postcard, and discovered the restuarant is called Brick Oven Pizzanini. At this point, Rigby crosses out the Brick Oven Pizza restaurants and marks the Pizzanini ones. It is now quarter past six, and Low Five Ghost has driven straight to the first Brick Oven Pizzanini. Hi Five Ghost comes out, and with a nod, confirms Celia isn't there either. They head straight to the next chain, and the guys are sad that Celia isn't at this chain. Back at the station, Westley has further analysed and printed out something interesting for Wes to see. It turns out the restaurant is called Mama's Famous Brick Oven Pizzanini. Wesley passes this onto the guys, who take note of it. Hi Five Ghost check the time worriedly, and it is roughly 23 to 7pm. They stop at a few more chains, and Low Fives continues driving. Hi Fives is more worried.)

Rigby: Aaah! Why are they all chain restaurants?

(A call comes in.)

Westley: Hey, I think we got something.

Low Five Ghost: (picks up the walkie-talkie) What's the sitch?

Westley: We got another word: Seven. "Mama's Famous Brick Oven Pizzanini on Seven".

Hi Five Ghost: Seven? You think it's on Seventh Street?

Rigby: There's one on Seventh Street in Magnolia!

Low Five Ghost: On it!

(He starts the accelerator, drives up to that restaurant, and parks. The guys get out and run up to the door. Moredcai pounds on it, but it won't open.)

Hi Five Ghost: It's locked!

Muscle Man: (noticing a sign) Ugh, it says they're fumigating this week.

Rigby: Aw, sick!

Hi Five Ghost: Now what am I gonna do? Guh! (pounds the door) No! (starts repeatedly knocking on the door) Celiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!

(The guys are shocked and try to get a hold of Hi Five Ghost.)

Mordecai: Fives, take it easy!

Rigby: She's not in there, man!

Muscle Man: She would've waited outside if this was the place!

(Hi Five Ghost stops knocking and breathes heavily. The guys let go of him.)

Mordecai: Sorry, dude. It's just not the right one.

Low Five Ghost: Guys, come here!

(Cut yo inside the cop car, where everyone listens in on a call.)

Wes: Alright, we finally got the whole line. She's waiting at: Mama Famous Brick Oven Pizzanini on 7- Goh!  Oh man, my chest!

Westley: Oh no, he's having a heart attack! Somebody call a doctor!

(Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Fives gasp.)

Hi Five Ghost: No! Not now!

(Everyone suddenly glares as they hear Wes laughing.)

Wes: Eh, just bustin' your chops! (The guys groan) But seriously, it's 'Grain'. "Mama's Famous Brick Pven Pizzanini on Seven Grain".

(They all look at each other.)

Mordecai, Rigby and Muscle Man: Oh yeah!

Muscle Man: That place is in the shopping centre across town.

(We notice the time in the cop car is 10 to 7.)

Mordecai: But there's only 10 minutes left! We won't make it with the traffic!

Low Five Ghost: (with a serious tone) Guess I better start flooring it then.

(He puts his car in acceleration and continues driving though the city, cutting through the traffic.)

Muscle Man: (pointing) There's the exit!

(Low Fives takes the exit and makes a turn, only to find more traffic.)

Rigby: How are we gonna get past this?!

(Low Fives looks round and see the mall.)

Low Five Ghost: Looks like we're gonna have to cut through the mall.

Hi Five Ghost: But isn't that illegal?

Low Five Ghost: (serious tone) Not when you're a cop it isn't. (suddenly makes a break through the mall as Hi Fives screams. The people at the mall clear the way.) Remain calm, citizens! Routine procedure!

(As he reaches the end of the mall, gthe guys scream as he breaks through the door and smashes into a fire hydrant. He groans.)

Muscle Man: There it is! (We are shown the exact restaurant) There's still time, bro!

(Hi Five Ghost comes out of the car, picks up a bouquet of roses, and heads for the restuarant. He opens the door to find a whole bunch of people staring at him. He notices an empty seat with change and a cup on the table, indicaing Celia was there. He heads back to the guys, who are waiting for him.)

Hi Five Ghost: They said she was there, but it's past 7 now. I was too late.

Westley: (via walkie takie) Guys, we found more to the note. It says, "P.S. One of my buttcheeks gained 600 pounds, and now I have to wear special pants." (laughs) Just bustin your-

Low Five Ghost: Dude, not the time.

Westley: Sorry.

Muscle Man: Look, Fives, I'm sorry you-

Hi Five Ghost: Thanks, but, I just wanna be alone right now. (floats off)

Rigby: We're still gonna get Pizzanini's, right? (Mordecai punches him) Oww!

(Cut to Hi Fives going down the street, throwing away his roses along the way. He notices the Cafe, where he and Celia first met. He heads inside.)

Hi Five Ghost: Can I get a half caff Americano?

Celia: (approaching HI Fives) Good choice. That's my favourite.

Hi Five Ghost: Celia!

Hi Five Ghost: I didn't know where you were! / Celia: I thought you weren't coming.

Hi Five Ghost: I wasn't sure what to do, and I just wound up here.

Celia: Me too.

Mordecai: The reign of your clan is over!

(He flings an envelope at Rigby, who gets up and holds up his hand in surrender.)

Rigby: For honor!

(He sticks the envelope at his body. Mordecai gets down for the sofa and pretends to slice him, and Rigby follows up by pretending to have committed seppuku.)

Rigby (continued): Samurai.

Mordecai: I thought we were ninjas.

Rigby: Eh, I'm winging it.

(He opens the envelope and takes out two papers.)

Rigby (continued): Hey, this one's for me! It's an invitation to our high school reunion.

Mordecai: No way, let me see that.

(He kneels next to him.)

Rigby: It says it's in two days.

Mordecai: What? So soon?

Rigby: We should totally go.

Mordecai: Ugh. Why? High school is so lame. Why would you wanna go back?

Rigby: Of course high school was uncool, I'm talking about how cool I was in high school, and how awesome it would be to show everyone I'm even cooler now. Here, follow me.

(They run upstairs laughing. Benson comes in and groans at the mess they left. In their room, Rigby takes out an old yearbook that says 'West Anderson High)

Mordecai: Whoa. I can't believe that you have this.

(Rigby flips over to the profiles and stops on a page.)

Rigby: Wo-ho-hoah! What do we have here?

(Rigby is looking at Mordecai's profile.)

Mordecai: Urrgh.

Rigby: "Activities - art club, dodgeball, jazz band"? Ha-ha! Oh yeah, you played the saxophone!

Mordecai: I signed up late and all the guitar spots were taken!

Rigby: That doesn't explain why you took your senior picture with it.

Mordecai: Well, yours can't be any better.

Rigby: We'll see about that.

(He starts flipping to it.)

Mordecai: I'm surprised you even got one since you didn't get your diploma.

Rigby: A-ha! Bam!

(He points to it. A picture of him riding a skateboard scooter is shown.)

Rigby (continued): Check out that photo.

(Mordecai points to something on the left page.)

Mordecai: Oh, right! It's your big To Do list! (reads) "A parting message for all you losers going to college. (takes yearbook) While you chumps write book reports and do math for 4 more years, I'm gonna be out having all the fun. Only jerks would choose more school."

(Flashback to Rigby's high school days. He is in the hallways with Mordecai talking to a girl)

Rigby: I'm gonna do way more cool stuff.

(Cut to him in the cafeteria.)

Rigby (continued): I'm gonna meet cool people! Go cool places and see cool things!

(Cut to him in the library.)

Rigby (continued): You're the ones who are gonna regret their choices!

(He gets tackled by security. Cut to him sitting outside the principal's office.)

Rigby (continued): I'll go to our reunion and rub it in your face, then you'l see!

(Cut to him talking to the principal.)

Rigby (continued): You'll all see!

Barbara: You're always making so much trouble for yourself. Now, Don never gets in any trouble when he's at school.

Mordecai: Rigby out? Then you have a long list stuff you said you'll do.

Rigby: Oh, no. Did I do anything on the list?

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: What do you mean? I can't go without doing something from the list?

Mordecai: Just don't go then.

Rigby: No, I have to go. If I'm not there, they'll think I didn't do anything after high school and I'm just some loser in a dead-end job. I can't let those guys make fun of me! I've got to do something from the list!

Mordecai: Well, you only have two days, let's see what you can get done. None of time for you to become a famous heart surgeon. Hamboning for pope won't work. Get picture taken while mooning on all seven continents? That's actually really cool, but no.

Rigby: Ugh! What about getting a slam dunk in the Olympics?

Mordecai: No.

Rigby: Kill a giant squid?

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: Having the world record for the largest feet in the world, and then kicking the biggest butt in the world?

Mordecai: Sorry, dude.

Rigby: Ugh! There's nothing on this list that I can do in time!

Mordecai: Hmm... What about this? Skydive while eating a burrito? You can probably do that in two days. Actually, that's the only one you can do in two days.

Rigby: Okay, then I'll do it! The sky doesn't know what's comin'. This is the place?

Mordecai: This is the place. It's the only skydiving school from miles.

Jumping Jim: Hello? Welcome to Jumping Jim's Skydiving Academy. I'm Jumpin' Jim. And are you boys ready to fall in love with skydiving? (laughing)

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhhh...

Rigby: Look, I need you to teach me how to skydive before tomorrow.

Jumpin' Jim: Oh, I see you got the real fire in your belly. Well, you bet I can. So let's get you straight to the fans. Now I'm gonna strap us together tandem-style.That way you'll get a feel for what it's like.

Rigby: I have to be strapped to you?

Jumpin' Jim: No one goes alone on their first jump. It just isn't done! Alright, let's get you suited up. Now I know what you're thinking, but don't look too down, son. Not all suits can be made of Chinese silk, real Italian suede, and embroidered in Iceland. But every jumper's got to start somewhere. Ha, ha!

Mordecai: Dude, burrito.

Rigby: Yeah, I gotta make sure I can get this right. Hit me. (Mordecai gives Rigby the burrito and puts it in his skydiving suit for safe keeping.)

Jumpin' Jim: Alright, here we go. Okay. when you're in the air, you want to stay focused. There's only a limited time-frame,- Whoa, son! What are you doing?

Rigby: Eating a burrito!

Jumpin' Jim: No! No snacks on the fan!

Mordecai: Rigby! (Rigby throws the burrito in the fan, making the blades of the fan shred it, and Rigby and Jumpin' Jim get covered to the goo condiments of the burrito. Then, Jumpin' Jim throws both Mordecai and Rigby out of his academy.)

Jumpin' Jim: Stay out of my school, and stay out of my sky!

It's over. There's no other place to go skydiving!

You should just go to the reunion anyway,who cares if you didn't do anything from the list?

Who cares? Everyone! They're all gonna know! I'll just be a loser who's done nothing since high school!

Muscle Man: You know who else has done nothing since high school? MY MOM! Okay, for real, bro. If you got to go skydiving while eating a burrito, I've got this guy who owes me a favor.

What guy?

Muscle Man: His name is Johnny, he's got a plane and has been known to take people skydiving from time to time. I'll take you tomorrow after Starla and I finish brunch. And by brunch I mean...

Ok, ok, we don't need to hear it. I just need a ride to this guy.

Alright, fine. I'll take you tomorrow right after Starla and I-

This looks like kinda shady. It doesn't matter.

As long as I can jump out the plane, That's fine.

Yo, Johnny! Johnny!

Huh? What? Yo, Muscle Man. How's it going, man?

Oh, you know, it's all good. How you been?

Pretty rad. Still doing the plane thing. Oh! I finally changed my last name to Skydiver!

Nice.

Mordecai: Rigby changed his name to Trash Boat once.

Stop talking! Can we just do this?

Anyway, I'm here on business. I'm calling in the favor.

Whoa, heavy, what do you need?

My buddy Rigby here needs to sky-dive today.

I don't know, man.I have to mow the runway, and then I've got this banner flying

I said I'm calling in, Johnny Skydiver!

OK, OK, you're right, I'll take him up.But I got to fix the plane real quick. Alright, just about to ready.

How am I gonna make it? There's only 20 minutes before the reunion.

Reunion? That's where I'm headed with the banner! You can do the stunt live and skydive straight into the reunion.

Rigby: Fine! As soon as I grab my stuff, we're hitting the sky! Alright, I got the parachute to live, got the burrito to eat, and the camera to prove it. That should be everything.

Dude, this doesn't seem safe. I don't think you should do this. I mean, who cares what your old classmates think of you? It's not important.

You don't understand, you were actually cool in high school. This is my only shot.

Rigby, we're good to go!

Mordecai: Rigby, please don't do this! Just lie at the reunion, and tell people you did it. They'll never know!

Rigby: You know, maybe you're right, maybe they wouldn't. But I would. Johnny Skydiver, let's get this bird in the air!

Mordecai: Dude, come on!

Muscle Man: Let him go, bro.

Johnny: Anyway, the jump site's coming up ,so let me hit you with some skydiving 101.You're gonna want to pull the cord on the right to release your parachute at anywhere between 3000 and 2000 feet. If your chute got tangled, just kick your legs like crazy. You can also grab the chute and throw it away from your body. And if that doesn't work, cut the lose and pull the preserve cord.

Rigby: What if that chute doesn't work?

Johnny: You've got the rest of your life to enjoy the view.

Rigby: Oh! oh.

Johnny: Don't worry, you'll do fine.

Rigby: Wait! You're not jumping with me?

Johnny: No, man! Someone's got to fly the plane.

Rigby: Who's flying it now? (Rigby and Johnny notice that no one's flying the plane.)

Johnny: Oh, crud!

(Johnny slides off of the screen as the plane starts losing control.)

Rigby: Whoa, ah! (the plane continues losing control) Whoa! Whoa! (slides off of the plane) Whah! Wah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH-AH-Ah-ah! (Rigby opens his eyes and notices that he's skydiving down to the reunion hall.) Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha! HA-ha-ha!! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!!! WOOOO!!!! Heh! (Rigby takes the burrito out of his suit, and tries to get the camera, but then he finally grabs the camera. Rigby rips the top paper part of the burrito, spits it out, and then gets the picture taken of himself pretending to eat the burrito while skydiving. Then, the picture comes out of the camera, but then it fly's away.) Na! (Rigby tries takes another picture, and this time he puts the burrito under his arm, and takes the second picture out of the camera, without making it fly away.) HA! (Rigby looks at his picture of himself pretending to eat the burrito while skydiving.) Perfect! (Rigby let's go of the camera, making it fly away and puts the picture in his suit for safe keeping. Then after Rigby skydives through a cloud, he notices the roof of the Reunion Hall.)The Reunion Hall! More perfect!

Mordecai: Dude, something is wrong with his chute.

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro.

Rigby: Go away!

Mordecai: Dude, he cut away his chute!

The preserve is his last chance.

Rigby: No! What do I do? What do I do? Burrito! Don't let me down, buddy! Promise to save my life before I let go of you? OK! Betrayal! Ha, Ha, Yeah! No!

Muscle Man: I don't know, man, I think that was his last burrito.

Mordecai: Wait, he's waking up!

Rigby: Uhh...Huh? Did I make it?

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. You went right through the roof.

Muscle Man: And you're not even dead.

Rigby: Uhh...Heh, heh, ha, ha, YE-HEAH!! No way I'm gonna die before all you losers, check this out! IN YO FACE!!! You thought I couldn't do it, but I did- Ugh! What the? I don't even need to skydive! Just look how ugly everyone got!

Mordecai: Wait, dude, these people are just really old.

Pops: Guys, hello!

Mordecai: Pops?

Rigby: What're you doing here? You weren't in our class.

Pops: Oh, of course not, silly. This is my class reunion. I meant to tell you my class president accidentally mailed my invitation to you.

Rigby: I guess I have time to get the slam dunk in the Olympics now.

Benson: Alright listen up, we've gotten some complaints about the huge sinkhole in the park.

Mordecai: Sinkhole? You mean the Crash Pit?

Muscle Man: You're talking smack about the Crash Pit, bro?

Benson: Yes. It's a potential liability and we're not properly insured for it. It has to be filled immediately.

Mordecai and Muscle Man: Aw, what?

Rigby: Aw, no way!

Muscle Man: Come on Benson, you can't fill up the Crash Pit.

Rigby: Can't we just put up more warning signs or something?

Benson: No! A thing called a "Crash Pit" shouldn't even be at the park in the first place.

Rigby: What if we call it a "small hole"?

Benson: JUST FILL IT UP BY THE END OF THE DAY OR YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!

(scene cuts to the guys holding two shovels and looking down at the Crash Pit sadly)

Mordecai: Man, I'm sure gonna miss this old Crash Pit.

Muscle Man: Yeah, bro, we had a lot of good times here.

(A montage of the two cars got hit and explode, Mordecai driving a bus with Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost, the guys bailed out of the bus, the bus goes down to the Crash Pit and explodes and people cheering, and The guys shaking all of the sodas and put them into an old car, the car goes down the Crash Pit, exploding, soda drops started to come out and the guys are tasting the soda drops. )

Mordecai: Hmm, good times.

Muscle Man: You thinking what I'm thinking?

Rigby: One last crash?

Mordecai: One last crash in the Crash Pit!

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

(Muscle Man presents a busted-up car to his friends. He also shows expired fireworks. And Muscle Man has a camera with a protective case in hand.)

Muscle Man: Ahh. Old Toluca. This baby got me around all through high school. I've been saving her for a moment like this. You got the camera, Fives?

Hi-Five Ghost: Yeah. I rented it from the park A/V with this protective cage, too.

Muscle Man: Nice. Gotta play it safe. Now to throw these expired fireworks into the trunk.

(He puts the fireworks in Old Toluca's trunk)

Muscle Man: Gotta send this puppy off with a bang!

(The four guys get in Old Toluca with the camera, and Muscle Man starts the stunt making road dounts)

Muscle Man: Savage! Savage! Savage! Whoo Whoo Whoo!

(Now they're driving straight to the Crash Pit.)

Mordecai: Dude, roll the camera! Roll the camera!

(Rigby powers on the camera)

Rigby: It's rolling! It's rolling!

(Mordecai takes the camera and points it to himself)

Mordecai: Ok, let me see, let me see. This is Mordo coming to you live for one last crash in the Crash Pit.

(He points the camera to Fives and Muscle Man)

Mordecai: Any final thoughts, Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: Savage! Savage! Savage!

(Mordecai points the camera to Rigby)

Rigby: Uh, I think we're getting too close, guys.

(Mordecai points it to the Crash Pit)

Mordecai: Don't bail on us now, dude. This is history in the making.

Rigby: No, seriously! I think we should get out now!

Mordecai: Dude, don't bail! Don't bail!

Rigby: DAAWHAHAAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!

(Rigby rolls out first. Muscle Man, Fives, and Mordecai laugh)

Mordecai: All right, let's go let's go!!

(Fives flies out of the car, Muscle Man and Mordecai roll out. The car heads straight to the Crash Pit. The car explodes with smoke and firework sparks coming out of the hole.)

Mordecai, Rigby Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Whoo-hoo!!!!!

Muscle Man: Best last Crash Pit ever! (high fives Hi Five Ghost)

Mordecai: And we got it on tape!

Mordecai and Rigby: Yea-yea-yea-yea!

Mordecai: Wait, where's the camera?

(One firework spark comes out of the hole)

Muscle Man: Oh, no bro!

Mordecai: Oh man, we've just destroyed the park camera!

Rigby: Benson's gonna kill us!

Hi-Five Ghost: Whoa, whoa, it's OK, guys, that protective cage probably kept the camera safe.

Rigby: Well, I'm not going down into some pit to get a cruddy rental camera back that's crazy!

Mordecai: Dude, chill we can probably just replace it. How much can an old camera cost anyway?

(Cut to Thomas working at a device storage)

Thomas: Let's see it's 5000 dollars.

Mordecai, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Aw, man.

Rigby: What?!

Mordecai: How can it be so much?

Thomas: It's the Vidmax Ultra-Res 30500, you can't get that clarity on VHS anymore, it's a collector's item.

Rigby: We can't afford that!

Thomas: Why, did something happen to it?

Muscle Man: No.

Thomas: 'Cause Benson reserved it to film his parents' wedding vow renewal tomorrow. If you guys lost that camera, he'll probably fire you.

Muscle Man: Nothing happen to it, stop prying into our affairs, Thomas! Huddle. (everyone huddles) We have to get that camera back.

Hi-Five Ghost: But how? The Crash Pit goes down forever.

Mordecai: We have no choice, it's either go into the pit or lose our jobs?

Muscle Man: Yo Thomas, where can we rent some climbing gear?

Thomas: You're in luck. I know a guy in the Rock Climbing Department. (the guys go to the Rock Climbing Department and Thomas puts on a hat) How can I help you guys?

Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man, and Hi-Five Ghost: Ugh...

(The gang begins their mission. Fives ties one end of a rope to a tree, and the others put their belts on.)

Muscle Man: Fives, cinch me!

(Fives does as told, Muscle Man grunts. Rigby throws the other end of the rope into the Crash Pit, and Muscle Man, Rigby, and Mordecai put the rope onto the belt hangers. The team climbs down to the bottom of the giant hole.)

Mordecai: Bottomless pit not so bottomless.

Rigby: YEAH! Take this, Crash Pit!

(Rigby tries to grip on the exit of the hole with two fingers.)

Rigby (imitating): Oh no, stop crushing me!

Muscle Man: Bros, check it out.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoaaaaa!

(The guys marvel at a junk yard made up of cars they threw in over the years.)

Mordecai: It's like a crash museum.

Hi-Five Ghost: It's glorious!

Rigby: Hey Muscle Man, there's your old summer home!

(A white camper is shown, followed by a green car)

Muscle Man: Casa del Sorenstein. Oh, and my old buddy the War Admiral!

(He sits on the War Admiral's front seat and butt grooves on it)

Muscle Man: Still got it. Hey, I wonder...?

(He opens the compartment to find a bag of beef jerky)

Muscle Man: Bonus!

(Fives found Old Toluca)

Hi-Five Ghost: Hey, guys, I found the car!

(The others go over to the car, and Muscle Man pulls out the cage used to protect the camera now busted up)

Muscle Man: Protective cage my butt.

Rigby: Where's the camera?

Muscle Man: I don't know. It wasn't in the car.

(A devilish laughter is echoed from a tunnel opening.)

Rigby: What was THAT?!

(More laughter is heard. And the guys notice footprints that go into the tunnel.)

Mordecai: Someone's in there.

Rigby: Aw, no way, man! This is freaking me out!

Mordecai: Dude, our camera could be in there.

Rigby: I'm not crawling into some dark hole!

Muscle Man: YOU'RE a dark hole!!!

Mordecai: Look, when Benson sees we haven't filled up this pit, he's gonna do it himself. And I don't wanna be down here when that happens. So let's just go get the camera and get out of here.

(Mordecai turns on a flashlight and walks into a tunnel with Muscle Man and Fives along. Rigby reluctantly follows.)

Rigby: UGH! Fine.

(Pops and Benson approach the hole)

Benson: RAAAAARGH! Why do I even bother?! I can't trust those guys to do the simplest task!

Pops: Well, this hole is rather big, Benson.

Benson: Oh, how hard can it be?

(Benson walks up to a shovel on a dirt pile and throws some dirt into the Crash Pit. Realizing how deep it is, he takes out his walkie-talkie)

Benson: Skips, Plan B.

(The guys approach the end of the tunnel)

Mordecai: Aw, man. Dead end.

Rigby: Well, we tried. Let's go back.

Mordecai: No, Rigby. We can't leave without the camera.

Rigby: Dude, forget this. The camera's gone and we're running out of time. Benson's probably gonna fill up the hole before we even get back, then we'll be trapped!

Muscle Man: Easy, bro! The dark is messing with your head. Now just calm down.

Rigby: Don't touch me! I can't breathe! Dark spaces! Need air!

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

Muscle Man: (laughing) That sound never gets old.

Rigby: That wasn't me.

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

Mordecai: Wait. It IS you, but... on the camera

(Mordecai approaches the wall and hears Rigby's girlish, hilarious scream. Some voices cackle to the scream)

Muscle Man: Whoa! Gnarly, bro!

Mordecai: The camera's gotta be on the other side

(Mordecai finds a shift gear installed to the wall)

Mordecai: It looks like a stick shift.

(Mordecai pulls it down to D and the rocks that form the wall come off to reveal a garage gate. It opens and the guys go in as Rigby's scream gets closer and the cackling gets louder.)

Mordecai: This way.

(The gang hides behind some barrels and notice a group of talking creatures holding onto the camera laughing to Rigby's scream.)

(The gang gasps)

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

(The creatures called the Carlocks laughed)

Carlock 1: I've never seen such cowardice.

Carlock 2: His scream is that of a tiny baby.

Rigby: Hey, I'm no baby!

Mordecai: Rigby!

(The Carlocks realized that the gang are behind the barrels)

Carlock King: Intruders!

(Two Carlocks grabbed and shoved Mordecai and Muscle Man)

Rigby: Who are you guys?

Carlock King: We are the Carlocks, the first and the last of our mighty underground race. Why have you disturbed our realm?

Mordecai: We don't want any trouble, we just want our camera back.

Carlock King: "Cam-er-a?" You mean this moving-picture machine? Nonsense. It was a gift from the Sky People.

Muscle Man: Sky People?

Carlock King: The great ones above who stow upon us the meaning of our very survival: our homes, our clothes, the occasional bag of beef jerky. For decades we lived with this as our only form of entertainment.

(Carlock 2 holds a toilet plunger with a rope on it)

Carlock 2: It was a ball and cup, but we ate the ball.

Carlock King: With this camera, we have been given the greatest gift of all: Laughter.

Rigby: Dude, there are no Sky People. That was just us messing around. You're living in a bunch of cruddy old cars we've crashed.

Mordecai: Look, we need that camera back or else we'll get fired. Just give it to us and then we'll get out of here.

Carlock 2: Perhaps we should listen to them my lord. Clearly that one is the screaming man-baby on the device.

Carlock King: Enough! The device stays with us. Now be gone, the best part's coming up.

(DAAWIHHHHAHAIAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

(Carlocks laughed which made Rigby get mad)

Rigby: It's not funny!

(Rigby charges for the king, he drops the camera, and Rigby grabs it as the king gets an accidental punch)

Rigby: Run!

(the guys bolt it as the Carlocks chase them growling)

Mordecai: Quick, into the car!

(two of the Carlocks are trying to stop them)

Rigby: Start the car! Start the car!

Muscle Man: I'm starting it!

(A Carlock smashes the window)

Rigby: DAAAAH!!!

(Rigby uses the flashlight on the Carlocks to hold them back). Muscle Man finally starts the car and the guys drive off)

Carlock King: After them!!

(The 6 Carlocks split into pairs, and they chase the guys with three cars)

Mordecai: Hold on...!

(Mordecai crashes through the hideout entrance and the Carlocks keep pursuing them. Carlock #2 jumps from Carlock #1's car onto the guys' car)

Guys: AAAAH!!

(Mordecai pushes him of the car and back onto Carlock #1's car. Carlock #1 loses his sight and he, Carlcock #2, and their car drive off the road and into a void, assumingly dying in the fall)

Rigby: We got 'em!

Mordecai:: Hm hm. Carlocks? More like "Drive-Off-The-Road locks"!

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAA- AAH!!!

(Two other Carlocks repeatedly bumped into the guys' car)

Guys: AAAAAAAHHHHH!!

(Benson and Pops are standing and Thomas is using an excavator)

Benson: Alright, let's hurry it up. The sooner this hole gets filled, the less likely we'll get hit with the lawsuit. (He takes out his walkie-talkie) Skips, you got the truck?

Skips: (riding a truck full of dirt) Yep.

Benson: Good, 'Cause I don't think Thomas is licensed to use an excavator.

Thomas: Uhhh... Ohh... (Thomas drops the dirt into the Pit)

(The Carlocks are still chasing after the guys)

Rigby: Uh, dude, how do we get out?

Mordecai: I don't know.

(The dirt lands on the bottom of the Pit. The guys gasps)

Mordecai: Hold on. (He floors the pump to speed up)

Rigby Dude?

(The guys are driving on the right side of the Pit)

Guys: AAAAAAAHHHHH!!

(Thomas drops down more dirt which the dirt landed on two Carlocks' car and exploded them. The last two Carlocks are driving after them.)

Mordecai: Almost there!

(The Carlock King jumps to the car to the open window)

Carlock King: Give us back the funny! (He and Rigby are struggling for the camera)

Rigby: It's not funny!

Benson: Dump it!

(Skips drops down a lot of dirt which made the Carlock and the car fall down and got crushed by tons of dirt. Now rocks are falling down. Muscle Man punched the Carlock King's face.)

Mordecai: We're almost out!

(They're almost out of the Crash Pit)

Mordecai: Hang on tight!

(Mordecai drives faster which made it knock off the king. The guys drive out of the Pit)

Skips: Huh?

(The guys are falling down)

Guys: AAAAAAAHHHHH!!

(The car lands on the ground twice and the last amount of dirt stars to fall)

Carlock King: NOOOO- (The king got hit by tons of dirt)

(The guys moan as they got out of the totaled car and the guys are hurt. Benson, Skips, and Thomas walks up to the guys)

Mordecai: We did it...

(Rigby gives the camera to Benson)

Benson: Did you guys just risk your lives to go get this camera?

Mordecai: Well, yeah it was park property and we couldn't replace it.

Rigby: We know you needed it for your parents' wedding thing tomorrow.

Benson: Oh, well thank you. Maybe now, my dad will stop yelling at me.

(The Crash Pit is now filled)

Muscle Man: (sadly) Goodbye, sweet Crash Pit...

Mordecai: Don't worry, Muscle Man. (picks up a video tape) I know what will make you feel better.

(Cut to the guys watching the video footage)

(DAAWHAHAAHAHAAAAAHH!!!!!)

(The guys laughed except Rigby)

Muscle Man: That did the trick, totally worth it.

Rigby: Good thing we never have to go down there again.

Thomas: Uhh, hey where's the climbing gear you guys checked out? (The guys are shocked)

Rigby: So he thinks the doctor can sew it back on?

Mordecai: Yeah, Muscle Man thinks so. He said it happened to his brother, too.

Rigby: (Whistles) Man, he's lucky.

Mordecai: Tell me about it. Anyway, it's getting pretty late; I'm gonna call it.

(Mordecai turns around, pulling back the blankets. A soda is heard being opened, and he turns to see Rigby drinking it.)

Mordecai: Are you seriously drinking a soda right now?

Rigby: (Burps) Yeah, you want one?

Mordecai: Dude, what? We'll be up all night and we have to work tomorrow.

Rigby: Nah, don't you watch the news? It's Daylight Savings tonight.

Mordecai: So?

Rigby: So, the clocks get set back an hour and we get to sleep in tomorrow morning!

Mordecai: Oh, yeah. Well, in that case: Soda me, broda me!

(Rigby throws him a soda)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Rapping) WHOO! Have a ball, baby. Let the party begin, it's Daylight Saving's when we get to sleep in!

(They open their sodas, spraying each other. Scene goes to the next morning. Mordecai and Rigby are walking to their designated area.)

Mordecai: (Yawning) Dude, I feel so rested.

Rigby: Me, too. Man, I wish every day was daylight savings.

(They walk to the house where a meeting is taking place)

Benson: Well, look who decided to show up. An hour late.

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh)

Rigby: They don't know. I guess you guys haven't heard of a little something called Daylight Savings.

(The others don't say anything)

Mordecai: Haha, yeah. Technically, you guys showed up an hour early.

(Rigby laughs)

Benson: (Benson mocks Rigby's laughter) Technically, Daylight Savings isn't until tonight.

Rigby: Really? Huh.

Mordecai: Oops.

Rigby: Whatever, dude; it's just an hour.

Benson: Oh, is it? Well, I guess you won't care that it's an hour you aren't getting paid for.

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, what?

Mordecai: C'mon Benson, what's the big deal?

Benson: Being on time is the big deal. This is a business we're trying to run. If everyone showed up late like you two, this whole park would fall apart.

Mordecai: It was an honest mistake, Benson. It's not like you've never been late to work.

Benson: Actually, I haven't. Because, unlike you two, I take my job seriously. And since you're having so much trouble keeping track of time, you can be in charge of setting the clocks back for the real Daylight Savings Time.

Mordecai: Ugh, fine. Come on Rigby, let's get this over with.

(They begin to walk off)

Benson: Hold it, not yet. You're gonna do it when the rest of the world does it: at two in the morning.

Mordecai: What? That doesn't even make any sense. What does it matter if everyone's on the same time?

Rigby: Yeah, what difference does it make?

Benson: Are you seriously making me defend the right time? You either set the park clocks back at two in the morning like everyone else, or you're fired!

(Scene goes to later that night. Mordecai and Rigby are playing video games.)

Mordecai: Dude, what time is it?

Rigby: It's 10 o' clock. That's like 4 more hours!

(They drink soda.)

Mordecai: I still can't believe Benson is making us wait until 2 to set the clocks back.

Rigby: I know! How does it even matter if the clocks are set to exactly the right time?

Mordecai: It doesn't! He acts like he'd be able to tell if the clocks were a little off! He wouldn't be able to tell.

Rigby: He totally wouldn't be able to tell! 

(They drink more soda)

Rigby: You know what, though? Technically we agreed to set all the clocks at the same time... but we didn't say anything about setting the clocks at the right time.

Mordecai: What are you thinking?

Rigby: How about we do what Benson says and set all the clocks back for Daylight Savings, but first, we set every clock in the park to the same wrong time, just to show Benson and everybody else that it doesn't even matter?

Mordecai: And then we'll come up to Benson in the middle of the day tomorrow and be like, "Hey Benson, all the clocks are wrong. You had no idea, did you?"

Rigby: I can't wait to see the look on his face when we tell him!

Mordecai: Man, this is gonna be awesome!

Rigby: WHOOO! (sprays Mordecai's face with soda) Daylight Savings!

Mordecai: (Angrily) Aw, come on, dude! I gotta wash my face, now!

(We cut to a montage of them changing the clocks everywhere in the park.)

(Song: The Clock Song )

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

Huh-huh. huh-huh, huh-huh

This is the clock song, we're setting all the clocks wrong

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

This is the clock song, we're setting all the clocks wrong

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

Benson's all about keeping track of time

But two in the mornin's where we draw the line

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

He does everything to keep you on track

But it doesn't really matter 'cause the dude is whack, whack, whack!

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

This is the clock song, we're setting all the clocks wrong

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

Huh-huh, huh-huh, huh-huh

(We fade out to the park where Mordecai and Rigby are sitting outside the house)

Rigby: Well, I think that's every clock in the park.

Mordecai: Heh, heh. This is gonna feel like such a- oh. Wait. This isn't gonna work unless we change the clocks in Benson's apartment. 

(Cut to Benson's office. Rigby opens the door.)

Rigby: Coast is clear. I'm pretty sure Benson keeps his spare apartment keys in his office. 

(Rigby takes the keys off the hook. Cut again to Benson's apartment. They both walk in. Mordecai chuckles as he changes the clocks in Benson's living room and kitchen. Rigby giggles as he changes the clock in his bathroom. Cut to Benson's living room.)

Mordecai: Okay, there's only one more clock in the house. Moment of truth: Are we bad enough dudes to teach Benson a lesson?

Rigby: Heck yeah, we are!

Both: Hmm! Hmm!

(Cut to the bedroom. Benson is sleeping inside. Mordecai and Rigby enter and walk quietly up to the alarm clock beside him. They look at a funny photo of him as a child. Benson is shown sitting on a swing as a child, with an embarrassing hairstyle and a stern scowl on his face. They giggle. Benson turns over. He opens his eyes a little.)

Benson: Huh?

(Mordecai and Rigby are frozen in fear. They're done for!)

Benson (mutters): Fine, I'll eat around it, then. (Drifts back to sleep)

(Mordecai quickly sets the alarm wrong and they both leave)

Both: (Chuckle) Yes, we did it! Haha!

(Cut to the next day, where Mordecai and Rigby are on the steps. Benson comes in.)

Benson: So, the mower's fine, car needs new tires...(Notices Mordecai and Rigby) Are you two actually the first ones here?

Mordecai: Mmm, yeah we are.

Rigby: We figured it was about time we started acting responsibly

(Mordecai chuckles)

Benson: Well, good. I'm actually glad to see you guys take a little initiative for once.

Rigby: Well, it had to happen eventually.

Mordecai: Haha, yeah. It was only a matter of time.

(They both chuckle while Benson stays unfazed. Cut to all the groundskeepers arriving.)

Benson: Ok. Now that everyone is here, let's get started. Some teens tipped over the porta potties again so someone's gonna hav-

Pops: Oh, good show!

Benson: Uh, what is it, Pops?

(Birds are flying around Pops)

Pops: It's the songbirds. (Chuckles) They usually don't come visit me until the afternoon!

Benson: Ummm...oh. I see. Well, next on the list is....

(Garbage truck comes in and Benson turns around)

Benson (continued): ...is uhh...

Garbage Man #1: Hey, yo. Mickey! How many bags you lugging over there?

Mickey: I got four stinky bags! What do you care?

(Throws bags in the truck)

Garbage Man #1: I'm just trying to make polite conversation, you lousy mug! Jeez!

(Mordacai and Rigby laugh)

Benson: That's weird. Garbage pickup isn't usually until eleven. And come to think of it, it's alarmingly hot for nine in the morning. Something's not...quite..(Sprinklers start hitting Benson) Gah! Why are the sprinklers going off two hours early?

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh again)

Mordecai: We set all the clocks to the wrong time and nobody even noticed! Everyone showed up two hours late today.

Both: Whooaaaaaa!

Rigby: We got you good, Benson!

Mordecai: And it was business as usual.

Rigby: Yeah, we told you it didn't matter if everyone was on the right time. Besides, time's just an abstract concept, anyway. It's not like anything bad is actually gonna-- (Rigby screams as the house starts shaking)

(A fire hydrant breaks in half and flies into the sky, a tree falls and breaks the gate fence, and then the park starts to float away as the guys scream)

Pops: Goodness, the park is floating!

Muscle Man: I'm gonna hurl, bro.

Rigby: LET ME OFF!

Benson: What did you two do?!

Mordecai: Nothing! Honest! Well, something, but...

Rigby: We set every clock in the park back three hours to mess with everyone!

Mordecai: It was just supposed to be a harmless prank!

(As the park continues to float, a little piece of the park falls, and a tree almost lands on Benson)

Benson: This doesn't look harmless to me! How on earth are we gonna fix this?!

Skips: Mordecai, Rigby, you've made a terrible mistake! When you changed every clock in the park, you officially changed the park's time zone.

Rigby: What does that even mean?!

Skips: It means that unless we can change every clock back to the right time, the park is gonna relocate to the new time zone. That means it's gonna set down somewhere in the middle of the ocean, and I don't think this rock is gonna float!

Rigby: Jeez, I always knew the park would sink, but I didn't think it would happen like this!

Benson: Nothing is sinking on my watch!

Mordecai: Benson, look out!

(Benson gets out of the way as a lampost almost falls on him. Pops' house starts to crumble.)

Benson: Alright, everyone! Reset all the clocks in the park!

(Everyone except Pops gets moving. Muscle Man, Fives and Thomas drive off in the cart. Skips scrambles into a bush. Benson, Mordecai and Rigby run into the house.)

Mordecai: Hurry!

(Pops watches them go, then he takes out his watch to reset it, but the house starts crumbling more, causing Pops to roll down the stairs.)

Pops: Bad show!

(Muscle MAN, Fives and Thomas have made it to the trailer. They run inside, but a tree chases down onto it, smashing it in half. Muscle Man falls through one half of the trailer.)

Hi Five Ghost: Muscle Man!

(Hi Five Ghost grabs the football clock and passes it to Thomas, who catches it but bangs into a drawer with the TV on top. The clock flies out of his hands. Muscle Man runs up and jumps to the other half of the trailer, squealing. He catches the clock and sets it to 11 o' clock. Meanwhile, Skips scrambles out of the bushes and goes to his house, as it starts rising from the ground and a tree falls in the gaps. Skips jumps down onto the tree, then jumps off it through the house window. He rolls to his clock, setting it to the right time. Back at the house, Pops tries to avoid the crumbling ground as he sets the time on his watch. In the house, Mordecai sets the time on the grandfather clock, Rigby sets the time on the alarm clock in his and Mordecai's room, and Benson sets the time on the hally clock. The three run outside, and see the park is still floating.)

Rigby: Why isn't it working?!

(Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Thomas and Skips meet up with the others.)

Skips: You must reset all of them! All of them!

Hi Five Ghost: (pointing) Everybody look!

(Benson's Apartment is floating behind the Park.)

Mordecai: Oh no! Benson's apartment!

Benson: What? You guys changed the clocks in my apartment?

Rigby: Sorry, man. It wouldn't have worked if we didn't change--

Benson: Aaaaah! How are we supposed to get over there?!

(Pops drives in with Carmenita.)

Pops: Get in!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Benson are in. The four of them drive off.)

Muscle Man: You got this, bros!

(Carmenita flies up to the apartment. They land on the roof, just before it sets down into the ocean.)

Rigby: We're setting down in the time zone!

(They run through the roof door. Mordecai and Rigby run through Benson's room door.)

Benson: Come on! I have a key!

(Mordecai sets the living room clock , Pops sets the kitchen clock, Rigby sets the bathroom clock, and Benson sets his alarm clock. They all meet up.)

Benson: That's all of 'em!

(The apartment sinks deeper into the ocean. Water rushes through the glass of the windows.)

Mordecai: No! The park!

(The water start flooding the park. Muscle Man, Fives Thomas and Skips are on Pops' house roof.)

Thomas: They're never gonna make it!

(Mordecai has drowned in the water. The TV floats past him. He speaks blubber-ish. He rises up against the ceiling.)

Benson: What are you guys forgeting?!

Mordecai: I don't know! (he sees Rigby's watch set wrong) Rigby, your wa- (drown)

(Rigby check his watch, then sets it to time right time. The park and the apartment suddenly rise up out of the ocean, and float back to the time zone, where they belong. Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Pops are coughing.)

Rigby: ♪This is the clock song, we're setting all the clocks wro-♪

Mordecai: Not now, dude.

Benson: Hello, Mr. Maellard! Huh, looks like he's not home. Help me bring these boxes inside, but don't touch anything or you're both fired.

Mordecai: Ok, ok.

(Benson pushes the doors open and enters Mr Maellard's house with Mordecai and Rigby following from behind)

Mordecai: Man, what's in these boxes?

Rigby: Yeah, this stuff is heavy.

Benson: Whatever it is, I'm sure its incredibly expensive, so be careful.

(Rigby places the box on the floor and wipes off sweat from his head)

Rigby: Phew! I wonder where the pool is?

(Both Rigby and Mordecai push a door open and enter a room with a lot of prized artifacts and other interesting objects)

Mordecai & Rigby: Wooahhhhh...

(In front of Mordecai and Rigby is a giant flat screen T.V. with an image of a dollar sign zooming up and down the screen)

Mordecai: That's the flattest flat screen I've ever seen.

(Rigby pushes a button on the wall and the flat screen drops downwards, revealing a large aquarium containing an octopus, a whale and three other fish)

Rigby: Nice. Arrgh!

(Benson yells at Rigby for touching the stuff)

Benson: Quit snooping around! Get upstairs and put those boxes away so we can leave before you two destroy the place.

Rigby: Fine, fine.

(Some classical music starts playing as Rigby puts a box down and leaves the room, and soon Mordecai leaves the room as well. Benson is left to pick up Rigby's box. Then through the open doors of another room we see Mordecai, Rigby and Benson, who walk past the room carrying boxes. However, Benson takes a few steps backwards, and looks into the room he had just walked past. There are several collectors items in there, such as a pharaoh's head, a sports car, an old classic car, a tyrannosaurus rex bone model and a bronze statue.)

Benson: Woah.

(Benson walks towards a glass cabinet holding a white guitar)

Benson: Is that a signed Bruce rock guitar?

(He looks at his reflection In the glass cabinet, and has a flashback. As a teenager he is seen being held up by a crowd that is cheering at a Bruce Rock concert that he had went to when he was younger.)

Bruce Rock: Are you ready to get rocked?!

(Then it shows Benson standing up in what looks like a black mustang, with his friend driving. They appear to be following the Bruce Rock tour Bus. It then shows a map of America where Bruce Rock went to different concerts. Then Bruce Rock is shown performing, and we see Benson in the audience smiling, until he views his own reflection again and comes back to reality. He pauses and thinks for a second before opening the glass cabinet and taking out the signed Bruce Rock guitar. He puts the shoulder strap over his shoulder and strums the guitar.)

Benson: Hahahahahahahah! (He looks around to make sure no one is watching him) Yeahhhh! (He strums the guitar like he is a rock star) Wooohoooo! Are you ready to get rocked?!

(Benson gets so excited, he jumps into the air with glee. However, when he does this, he accidentally ends up breaking the guitar by smashing the top part of it against the bronze statue. Mordecai and Rigby then enter the room.)

Rigby: Benson, we're finished, we can-

Mordecai & Rigby: Woah!

(Benson is standing there with the broken Bruce Rock guitar, a shocked look on his face)

Mordecai: What happened to not touching anything?

Benson: I... I don't know! I got carried away. This guitar is worth more than my life! Maellard is going to fire me for sure if he doesn't kill me first!

Mordecai: Ok, ok, wait. It might not be so bad. Maybe we can find some glue and...

Benson: (Lets out a loud cry) Arghhhaarrghhh! I'm ruined! There's no way I can... (Looks up in realization) Wait! You two! You can help me.

Rigby: Uh, we can?

Benson: You guys are always wrecking stuff and getting away with it; you're practically experts!

Mordecai: (Looks down at Rigby and then back up at Benson) Hm, we're totally experts. Don't worry, Benson, we can help you fix this.

Benson: You can?

Mordecai: Sure! All we gotta do is get another signed Bruce Rock guitar, and then we'll sneak it in here before Maellard realizes anything's wrong. Don't worry, dude, with our help, you're not gonna get fired.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson in the computer room, using the computer to find out if there are any Bruce Rock tickets online. Mordecai is typing on the computer with Rigby and Benson sitting beside him.)

Mordecai: Alright. The way I see it, Bruce Rock is always on tour, right?

Benson: Yeah.

Rigby: Well then the best way to see him is to go to his next concert, and then just go up to him and ask for another autographed guitar.

Mordecai: Oh, hey, what do you know? He's playing tonight.

Benson: Are you serious? He's in town? That's amazing! (Laughs) Man, you guys really are good.

Mordecai & Rigby: Hehehe, yeah.

Mordecai: Let's buy the tickets.

(Mordecai tries to buy the tickets, but a message pops up saying that they're sold out)

Rigby: Aw man, it's sold out!

Benson: Oh no! I'm gonna get fired and lose all of my retirement benefits! Oh man, oh man!

Mordecai: Dude, just relax.

Rigby: Yeah, the first plan never works.

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson decide to go to Muscle Man, who appears to be welding something. Muscleman turns around and lifts his face protection mask.)

Muscle Man: Talk to me.

Mordecai: Benson broke Maellard's guitar that was signed by Bruce Rock...

Muscle Man: Ah! Say no more bro, I'll give my buddy Ronnie a call, he'll take care of it for you.

Rigby: Who's Ronnie?

Muscle Man: He's one of Bruce Rocks roadies; he can totally get Benson another signed guitar.

Benson: Nice.

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmhmhmhmhm!

Mordecai: Thanks, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: No worries.

(Muscle Man gets back to his welding, but he is actually just cooking a T-bone steak on a barbecue grill with a welding torch)

Muscle Man: Mmmmmmm, T-bone.

(It is night time and Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Muscle Man are at the Bruce rock concert, which is taking place at the convention center. There is a large group of Bruce Rock fans who are waiting outside, shouting Bruce Rocks's name over and over.)

Crowd: Bruce Rock! Bruce Rock! Bruce Rock! Bruce!

(The camera then zooms in to the side alleyway of the convention center, where Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Muscle Man are standing. Muscle Man is talking to Ronnie.)

Muscle Man: Thanks again for doing this, Ronnie.

Ronnie: Hey, don't mention it bro; I still owe you for that night outside of Dooley's.

Muscle Man: Hehehehe. (Muscle Man and Ronnie high five each other)

Benson: It's Bruce Rock! It's Bruce Rock!

Ronnie: Hey Bruce, this is the guy Benson that I was telling you about.

Bruce Rock: Hey; what's up, man?

Benson: Mr. Rock, I would just like to say that it is an honor.

Bruce Rock: Right on, brother. I'll sign this guitar for you after the show. Hey: stay gold.

Benson: Thanks, Bruce!

Rigby: Man, he is looking old!

Benson: Hey, have some respect, he's an American icon!

Bruce Rock: Are you ready to get rocked?!

(The crowd cheers, and Benson raises his arms in the air)

Benson: Wooohoooo! I can't believe he's jamming after all these years. Bruce Rock is gonna live forever!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson are just standing there, enjoying the music, when suddenly, something is heard crashing down, and a high pitched sound blares from the microphone.)

Anonymous: Somebody call an ambulance!

(The guys are at home watching the news report on T.V. A news reporter and an image of a helicopter lifting a body is shown.)

News Reporter: We have received confirmation that American icon Bruce Rock has died after tragically falling off a five-foot stage. Sources say that Bruce's old, old body just couldn't handle the fall.

Benson: I'm finished. This job was everything I had.

Mordecai: Relax, Benson, we already have a backup plan for situations like this.

Benson: (Sighs) Fine, what's the backup plan?

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson visiting Death's house)

Death: Ain't no way you can contact Bruce Rock. When someone like him dies, they end up in the Rock and Roll Underworld. It's very exclusive. You're forbidden to enter unless you're a bonefied rock star, and you three losers don't exactly fit that description.

Rigby: Losers?! We're totally rock and roll.

Mordecai: Down to the bones.

Death: Fine, but you own me big. When you least expect it, you're gonna have to babysit Thomas.

Mordecai: We accept.

Benson: I won't have to babysit Thomas, will I?

Mordecai: Nah, we'll weasel out of it somehow.

Death: Now we gotta make you guys look like proper rock stars.

(Some type of rock music starts playing. Death hands Benson some clothes, Mordecai puts on a glove, Rigby puts on a pair of trousers with suspenders, and Benson puts on a leather jacket. Then the music ends with them standing there looking like rock stars.)

Death (continued): Now you need some Rock and Roll names.

Rigby: I'm gonna be 'Awesome Johnson'!

Mordecai: I wanna be 'Five - Knuckle Joe'.

Rigby: 'Rusty skull Bone'.

Mordecai: 'Lightning Jimmy-Joe Johnson'!

Death: Those are the worst Rock and Roll names I've ever heard. For this plan to work, they have to be just right. (Death points at Mordecai) Zander Mercury. (Death points at Rigby) King Pluto. (Death points at Benson) Max Amps.

Mordecai: Woah... good names.

Death: I know. Now let's go.

(The guys follow Death to his motorcycle)

Death (continued): Everyone on.

(Death revs his motorcycle and dives into a portal, which souls are seen flying out of)

Mordecai Rigby & Benson: Ahhhhh!

(The motorcycle bounces and lands on the ground, stopping right in front of the entrance of the Rock and Roll Underworld.)

Death: Welcome to the Rock and Roll Underworld.

(The camera shows an evil looking bouncer guarding the entrance)

Benson: How are we gonna get past that guy?

Death: Don't worry about him. I'm gonna put you guys on the list.

(Death sends a wave of light towards the clipboard with his mind and inserts their names on the list)

Death (continued): Now act like you belong.

(Mordecai, Rigby, Benson and Death walk towards the entrance of the Rock and Roll Underworld, approaching the bouncer)

Death (continued): Their tour bus just flew off a cliff, aint that right boys?

(Death punches Mordecai)

Mordecai: Yeah, I'm Zander Mercury, and these two jokers are King Pluto and Max Amps.

Rigby: We're on the list.

(The bouncer checks his list to see if the three names are on it, which they are. He then looks back up at Mordecai, Rigby and Benson before crossing out the the names with his pen.)

Rigby (continued): Cooool.

Bouncer: Alright, you guys are good.

(He unhooks a chain, allowing them to enter)

Death: This is as far as I can go. And remember what I told you: if you're caught, you'll be exiled to the Fake Rockstar Underworld for all eternity!

Benson: Wait, what? You never told us that.

Death: Yeah I did. I'm... pretty sure I did. Back at the, uh...

(Snaps his fingers)

Benson: (Turns to Mordecai and Rigby) No, he didn't! Gaaaah! I can't believe I'm doing this; just take me back, I don't wanna do this anymore!

(The bouncer turns to look at him)

Rigby: Hey, cool it! You wanna keep your job or not?

Mordecai: Yeah, settle down, Benson. You asked for our expertise, well this is how we roll. Now let's get that guitar.

(They enter the Rock and Roll Underworld. Several people are walking around and talking.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Woah!

Mordecai: This place is crazy!

Rigby: Woah, is that Igby Stallion over there?

(The camera shows a guy sitting beside a guitar that is on fire. He then proceeds to place a steak in the flames.)

Mordecai: (Pointing) And I'm pretty sure that's Ronnie Rugburn sitting over at that table.

(Ronnie bites into what appears to be wood)

Rigby: Dude, there goes Crash!

(A guy with long hair and a guitar walks by)

Mordecai: Wait, isn't Crash still alive?

Rigby: Oh, yeah... maybe he has a day pass or something.

Benson: (Points) Ah! At the back of the club! There's Bruce!

(They all run to the back of the club yelling 'Bruce')

Bruce Rock: Ah, hey boys; good to see ya.

Mordecai: Hi, sir. Sorry about the whole dying thing.

Bruce Rock: Pffft, you kidding me? I love being dead. Down here I can rock for all eternity! I feel young again.

Rigby: Yeah, you don't look super old like you did before you died.

Bruce Rock: Thanks! You boys still need that signed guitar?

Benson: Yes, sir. If... that's okay?

Bruce Rock: Of course! Now, who has a pen?

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson just look at each other)

Benson: Nobody brought a pen? You have got to be kidding me.

Mordecai: Wait. I know where we can get one.

(The camera zooms in to the bouncer's pen, and then the bouncer himself)

Benson: You want to ask the bouncer for his pen?

Mordecai: Yeah! Couldn't hurt to ask.

(An anonymous man walks up to the bouncer)

Anonymous: Oi, mate, can I borrow your pen?

(The bouncer grabs the man and throws him up into the ceiling, where he explodes)

Benson: No way! I'm not going anywhere near that guy.

Mordecai: Listen; this is the point of no return, where you have to take a huge risk for a huge reward.

(Benson realizes this and sighs. He then proceeds to walk up to the bouncer.)

Benson: Excuse me. I noticed your jacket earlier and... I was wondering. Is that leather?

(As Benson is distracting the bouncer, Mordecai and Rigby sneak up and try to grab the bouncer's pen. Before they can get ahold of it, however, the bouncer crosses his arms, putting the pen out of reach.

Benson (continued): (Laughs nervously) Uh... I just wanted to let you know it looks great. And uh...

(Mordecai is seen walking back over with Rigby on his shoulders)

Benson (continued): It kind of looks like my jacket! 

(Rigby reaches for the pen)

Benson (continued): Except mine doesn't have the skulls. It has... tassles. You see? Tassles...

(Rigby is finally able to reach the pen. He is shown holding onto Mordecai eyelids, however, and Mordecai's legs are wobbling from Rigby's weight. No sooner does Rigby touch the pen, the duo fall right in front of the bouncer.)

Bouncer: Hey! (He takes back his pen and picks up Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson) Who'd you say you guys were again?

Mordecai: Zander Mercury.

Benson: Max Amps.

Rigby: Uh... uh... Max King!

(The bouncer gives him an unconvinced look)

Rigby: (Looks down) Um... muscles! King Muscles!

Bouncer: Prove it!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson are then seen on stage in front of a bunch of people)

Bouncer (continued): Come on! Play something!

Mordecai: Alright. Let's do this! One, two, three, four!

(They all horribly start to play their instruments)

Rigby: (off-key) Yeah! (Bangs on a keyboard) We're rock and roooooooooll!

Bouncer: You guys aren't rockstars!

(He turns into a griffin-like creature and swoops down towards Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson. The three friends scream in terror. The bouncer quickly grabs them before they can react.)

Bouncer (continued): You guys just bought yourselves a one way ticket to the Fake Rockstar Underworld!

Benson: We're gonna be okay, right? This stuff happens all the time, right?!

Rigby: No, this has never happened!

(A portal opens up behind them. The bouncer tries to throw the fake rockstars in, but they hang onto each other. Mordecai quickly grabs onto the bouncer's arm and hits him in the face with Mr. Maellard's guitar, sending him to the ground in pain and giving himself, Rigby, and Benson a chance to escape.)

Mordecai: Get the pen!

(Bruce Rock, along with a big crowd of people, is seen cheering as they watch Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson outsmart the bouncer. Rigby decides to gloat as he takes the bouncer's pen.)

Rigby: In your faaace!

(As soon as he says this, the bouncer roars, causing Rigby to scream and run away with Benson and Mordecai)

Mordecai: Bruce! We got the pen!

(Bruce quickly takes the guitar and runs alongside Benson, Mordecai, and Rigby as the griffin pursues them. He writes his name down, which permanently becomes ingrained in the guitar.)

Bruce Rock: (Hands the guitar to Mordecai) Here.

Mordecai: Thanks, Mr. Rock.

Benson: Yeah, thanks, Mr. Rock.

Bruce Rock: And always remember: (He rolls away) Stay gooooooooold!

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson continue running as the bouncer flies above them. They quickly duck under the chain that is covering the entrance as the bouncer bursts through the wall just over their heads.)

Death: Get on! 

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson quickly hop onto Death's motorcycle. Death takes off, only to be easily pursued the bouncer.)

Mordecai: Death!

Rigby: He's gaining on us!

(A portal opens up in front of them, right as the bouncer is about to catch up. Mordecai screams as the bouncer almost manages to grab him. Just before that can happen, however, Death pulls up on the handlebars and pulls them through the portal, leaving the griffin to fly around in defeat. They manage to arrive back at Death's house, though Death can't see that because his eyes are covered by Benson's hands.)

Death: I can't see!

(They end up crashing right beside the entrance of the house, destroying Death's motorcycle and leaving them all sprawled out on the ground. Luckily, Benson is able to pull himself up and grab the guitar.)

Benson: We did it!

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson back at Mr. Maellard's house. Benson is shown putting the guitar back in its place.)

Benson (continued): (Laughs) Man, you guys really bailed me out of that one.

Rigby: What can we say? It's what we do. (He gives Mordecai a high-five)

(Just then, Mr. Maellard walks into the room)

Benson: Mr. Maellard's coming! Be cool.

(Mordecai and Rigby quickly turn around)

Mr. Maellard: So, uh, you fellas like Bruce Rock, do ya?

Mordecai Rigby & Benson: Yeah.

Benson: My all-time favorite.

Mr. Maellard: Yeaaaah. (He walks over to the case and pulls out the guitar) I got this baby so that every now and then, I can feel like a rockstar.

(Right after he says this, he takes the guitar and smashes it on the ground, causing Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson to gasp and look on in pure shock)

Mr. Maellard (continued): It's good to be rich!

Skips: Alright, fellas. Time for lunch.

(Digs into his cooler)

Skips (continued): Ok, got one for Mordo.

(He tosses a sandwich to him)

Skips (continued): Rigby, think fast!

(He tosses a burrito at Rigby, but instead of catching it, it only hits Rigby in the face)

Rigby: No!

(The burrito plummets to the ground, its contents splattering all over the place)

Mordecai: (Laughs) Should've gone for it, dude.

Rigby: Awww! If I was immortal like Skips, I would've gone for it.

Mordecai: Yeah that would be awesome.

(Skips hands over a sandwich to Rigby)

Rigby: Being immortal must rule, right, Skips?

Skips: Nah, not really.

Mordecai: I bet you could survive the vacuum of space though.

Skips: Gotta breathe. Being immortal doesn't change that.

Rigby: Ooh ooh, I got one! Swimming one hour after eating.

Skips: That has never killed me.

Mordecai & Rigby: Wow.

Mordecai: Okay, okay. If somebody cut off you head, put it into a jar...

Skips: Look fellas, you got this immortally thing all wrong.

Rigby: Hey, how did you become immortal anyway?

Skips: Nah, you don't wanna hear that.

(He drinks a soda)

Mordecai & Rigby: Awwwwww!

Mordecai: Come on, please?

Rigby: Yeah, please?

(Mordecai and Rigby begin to badger Skips until he finally gives in)

Skips: Alright. I'll tell you how I got my immortality.

Mordecai & Rigby: (High five each other) Yeah-yuh!

Skips: A long time ago, in a high school far, far away...

(As Skips begins his story, we are introduced to an average looking building. A sign out front labels it as Bennett High School. A few students are seen milling around out front, and a voice is heard addressing someone inside.)

Headmaster Bennett: Mister Walks. 

(A young Skips, named Walks is seen sitting in a chair, looking bored)

Headmaster Bennett (continued): According to your permanent record, you've been expelled from three schools this year alone. And this was due to (lowers the permanent record folder) fighting and pugilistic tendencies?!

(He glares at Walks, who looks down at his nails, disinterested) 

Walks: Yeah, I mighta done some of that.

Headmaster Bennett: Well, one fight at my school, Mister Walks, and that means expulsion.

Walks: (Puts his hands up to his face, pretending to be afraid) Ooooh! School's worthless to an adventurer such as me!

(Bennett pulls himself up out of his seat)

Headmaster Bennett:  This is your last chance to graduate, Walks. Do you wish to remain a scoundrel or better yourself? Gareth!

(A young Gary opens the door, causing Walks to turn his head)

Gareth: Yes, Headmaster Bennett?

Headmaster Bennett: Show Walks to his locker.

(Walks is shown kicking open the door on his way out, which Garreth gently shuts behind him)

Walks: I don't need your help, Gareth. I can find my own way around.

Gareth: (Who runs to catch up with Walks) Wait! Walks, I cast no doubts upon your navigation skills, oh great adventurer! (Walks rolls his eyes) But do you know how to navigate socially? 

(They burst through a set of doors, Walks exclaiming a loud 'Woah!' at what he sees before him) 

Gareth (continued): Walks, follow me. (They begin to walk around as Garreth points out everything) Over here we have the athletes and cheer directors. 

(A group of people are seen standing around with props. There is even a guy dressed up as a dodo bird.) 

Gareth (continued): And over yonder, bookish types. 

(A group of boys are seen standing around, looking at books and observing different things) 

Gareth (continued): Hark! I hear some dramatics.

Dramatic Student: Alas, poor yorick.

Gareth: And there's the goths, mobs and settlers.

(We are shown the respective cliques)

Gareth (continued): Here's my clique.

(We see five floating men.)

Immortal Student Council: (All singing) We welcome you, we welcome you!

Reginald: On behalf of the Immortal Student Council - and Glee Club - welcome to your locker, Walks!

(Walks goes to his locker.)

Reginald (continued): You should join us.

Walks: Why?

Reginald: Nothing wins you more respect in school than student government.

(Suddenly Klorgbane The Destroyer tackles Reginald hitting him on the locker)

Klorgbane The Destroyer: Reginald, Reginald heads as big as a shed-ginald. (Turns his head around at The Guardians of Eternal Youth) Hello immortal student council, how are we today.

Boswald: Oh... I need a new diaper.

Reginald: Uh, please brother Klorgbane no wet willies or wedged underclothes today.

Walks: Yeah, leave them alone.

Klorgbane The Destroyer: Eh, who's this, who dares interrupt Klorgbane?

(People become shocked as they gather around to see Walks and Klorgbane face to face)

Walks: I'm Walks. You don't scare me.

Klorgbane The Destroyer: Leave them alone or what, Walks? Huh? (pushes Walks) or what, (He pushes him again) huh?

(Walks pulls his hair up and pushes Klorgbane, and as they lock each other and ready to fight)

Klorgbane The Destroyer: Nobody touches me!

(Headmaster Bennett walks in)

Headmaster Bennett: What's going on here?

(Walks and Klorgbane sweep away the dust on their clothes and turn around on Headmaster Bennett)

Walks: Oh nothing, we're just getting to know each other.

Klorgbane The Destroyer: Yes, looks like we're really going to hit it off. (Giggles)

(As Headmaster Bennett looks at them he walks away to the hallway as Klorgbane turns around at Walks)

Klorgbane The Destroyer: This isn't over.

(The crowd along with Klorgbane walks away.)

Reginald: Nobody's ever stood up to Klorgbane before.

Walks: Walks never walks away from a jerk.

(The Guardians of Eternal Youth look at each other having an idea. We cut back to Mordecai, Rigby and Skips)

Rigby: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa You went to high school with all those guys.

Skips: Yeah we have a long history together. What'd you expect from a bunch of immortals.

Rigby: Wait how did you get your immortally.

Skips: I'm getting to that, so lunch time rolled around, and it seemed like everybody already have their tables all figured out.

(The story continues with Walks entering the cafeteria with his food and trying to find a table until see meet a girl holding an apple)

Mona: There's a spot right here, you're welcome to dine with me if you wish.

Walks: I eh.. eh.

(A young girl eats an apple as Walks looks at her a little paranoid)

Mona: Do you wish to dine with me?

Walks: Oh.. Uh eh eh, beg pardon uh yes thank you I...I was just.

Mona: Starring vacantly in my direction.

Skips: Ho, ho, ho you caught me eh, eh beg pardon again.

Mona: My given name is Desdemona, but you can call me Mona.

Walks: I'm Walks, as in..... well Walks it is far as my name was shorted.

Mona: Oh... you mean to say that no one calls you Alks?

Walks: Hard to believe that big name never took room.

(He drinks the soup and suddenly spits it out)

Walks (continued): Ugh, 'tis terrible!

(Mona laughs and wipes the soup on her shirt with her napkin)

Mona: You must new here, no on eats the school lunch that can be avoided. Somehow the kitchen even ruins Apple Brown Bette.

Walks: Really? How does one even do that?

(He laughs)

Walks (continued): There are only four ingredients.

(Gareth and the council go up to him. The council is holding portraits in hand.)

Gareth: Walks!

Walks: Huh?

Gareth: My baby friends and I have a proposition for you.

Walks: What sort?

Gareth: We'd like to formerly request that you fight Klorgbane.

(He unfolds a chart.)

Gareth (continued): We believe it upon examination of this chart.

Walks: No need, I was going to fight him anyway.

Reginald: Oh, splendid.

Griswald: To assure Klorgbane's defeat we've begun design of a device called (reveals design) The Fists of Justice, which will-

Walks: Call off your design. All the fists I need reside in my pockets.

Gareth: Hear them out, Walks. Archibald holds a very convincing illustration.

Archibald: Like us, Klorgbane the Destroyer was created immortal.

(He unfolds a picture of Klorgbane's creation and immortality.)

Archibald (continued): He therefore cannot be defeated by a mere mortal.

(Reginald unveils a picture of how Walks' mortal battle would play out. Walks whistles in amazement. Another guardian appears with a picture.)

Oswald: However, with the proper weapon, a mortal of your strength and skill may prevail.

(He has a picture of Walks besting Klorgbane with The Fists of Justice.)

Walks: Let me see that.

(Oswald gives him the picture.)

Walks: Hmm, I'll consider that.

Gareth: We do help you will.

(He bows and they walk away)

Walks: Anyway, at my last school... (He turns to find Mona has disappeared, but to find Mona's eaten apple on the table) Mona?

(Mona walks out of the cafeteria)

Walks: Mona! Mona, wait up! (Runs and catches up to her and places his hand on her shoulder) Hey, what happened back there? I turned around and you were gone.

Mona: I heard what you're planning.

Walks: I know, you were sitting right across from me.

Mona: Well, I didn't like it. I thought we had a special connection, Walks, but I'm not into man who fight. So, fare-thee-well.

Walks: Wait, no! I don't fight. (Shows his hands to her) Look, no fists.

Mona: Very funny.

Walks: No, Mona, please! Forget about the fight. We do have a connection. Let's just get to know each other, go for a canoe ride, perhaps.

Mona: I'm not really into canoes, either.

Walks: (holds up the eaten apple) You left this on the table. (Gives it to Mona) You know, I'm not really into litter bugs. But I was willing to reconsider for you.

Mona: (laughs) If you really get to know me, we could use another set of hands making decoration on the prom committee. That's where I spend my free time.

Walks: Where do I sign up?

(We cut to the auditorium where students are working on the props for the prom committee. Walks comes in and sees a banner that says "Enchantment Under the Sea")

Drama Teacher: Mona, everybody wants to know what's the prom theme this year?

Mona: Well, it's an undersea-theme. I envision the scallops over there, and over here...

(Walks pops out, surprising Mona as she screams)

Walks: What's a-happening, Mona?

Mona: (laughing) Oh, it's just you, Walks. Come down from there, help me with this. (Walks comes down from a woodwork table and walks with her) Do you know anything about tools?

Walks: Of course. I am a great adventurer.

Mona: How many adventures have you actually been on?

Walks: Oh... a lot. I chased storms with a fellow named Samson some years back.

Mona: (as she gives Walks a hammer) Well, this adventure is called hammering two pieces of wood together.

(Walks, pounds a nail with the hammer, but it gets damaged and he groans)

Mona: Walks, it's not just about force. Take your time. And if your aim is true, then...

(Mona helps Walks pound the nail with the hammer correctly)

Walks: The nail is driven in.

Klorgbane: Mona, him? Seriously?

Walks: What do you want, Klorgbane?

Klorgbane: To finish what we started.

(Klorgbane and Walks get ready to fight, but Mona shooks her head sadly wand walks away)

Walks: Uh... Klorgbane, you're not worth it! I won't fight you!

(Mona looks at Walks)

Klorgbane: What?!

Walks: I said, I won't fight you! (Turns around)

Klorgbane: You won't or you can't? Coward! (Walks out of the auditorium)

Mona: Walks, That was so brave! (as Walks is panting) You used words instead of violence.

Walks: How about these words, Mona? Do you wish to go out with me tonight?

Mona: Oh, um, alright.

Walks: Splendid! See you at 7:00. (Runs out of the auditorium)

Rigby: (voice-over) Wait, wait. (We cut back to him, Mordecai and Skips) Your story was just about to get awesome, and now it's a mushy romance? I'm sorry Skips, but... Pffft! (Mordecai punches him) Ow! I bit my tongue!

Mordecai: Skips, please continue.

Skips: So, with his power unchecked... (The story continues with Klorgbane watching Headmaster Bennett walking by.)...Klorgbane did what he wanted. Bennett was clueless.

Klorgbane: Ooh, what's that on your cravate? (He punches the dodo bird guy, turns his dodo head and kicks him to the ground.)

Dramatic Student: To flee or not to flee! Aaah!

(Klorgbane lands and sits on the Dramatic students as he laughs evilly.)

Walks: Rrrgh!

Reginald: (voice-over) Walks.

(The Immortal Student Council and Gareth appear)

Walks: Reginald, what am I to do here? Something must be done about Klorgbane, but if we fight, Bennett will expel me and Mona will lose interest in me. Oh, high school is so complicated.

Reginald: But Walks, you must. It is for the greater good. Mona and Bennett will forgive you once they understand.

Walks: And this you promise?

Gareth: Our promises are as great as gold. After all, we are the student government.

(The Immortal Student Council all agree)

Reginald: Please, Walks. You are our only hope.

Walks: Hmmm, alright.

Reginald: Wonderful!

Gareth: Our people will contact his people and set up a fight time and place.

Walks: And it will not conflict my time with Mona?

Reginald: Of course not.

Walks: Fine. Now begone! (They disappear) I have a date.


AD
Part 2
(Scene begins in a montage. Walks and Mona are on their date at Ye Olde Cheezer's and working on the props for the prom while the Immortal Student Council work on the Fists of Justice. We are then shown with Walks and Mona in the hallway as she is skipping in front of him, then to the Immortal Student Council cooling down the fists with water, then Walks and Mona are teasing each other by putting paint in each other's noses, then the Immortal Student Council screwing the fists together, then Skips and Mona play with the seahorse props, then the Immortal Student Council wiping the fists, then Walks and Mona kissing behind the seahorse prop as the Immortal Student Council finish the fists and Walks and Mona skip along and spun together as the montage ends. We cut back to Mordecai, Rigby and Skips.)

Rigby: Woah, the babies finally finish the Fists of Justice! Finally, we're getting to the good stuff!

Skips: Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh. So, we spun, and, we spun, and we spun, and we spun. (Rigby groans) Then, we skipped, and we skipped, and we skipped...

(The story continues with Walks and Mona finish skipping in the hallway)

Mona: Okay, we skipped around the school three times, and I'm starting to cramp up.

Walks: Oh, come on, one more loop?

Mona: (giggles) I'm gonna have to start calling you Skips if you keep this up. I really should go before the bell rings, though.

Walks: Wait, Mona, before you go, I have a gift for you. (Gives Mona a necklace with a heart-shaped locket on it)

Mona: A gift? (She opens the locket to reveal two pictures of her and Walks) Oh, Walks, I love it!

Walks: Remember that time there was a bee on your hat, And I let you sit still for what felt like eternity until it flew away?

Mona: Yes.

Walks: That was no bee! I only told you that so I can take you a photograph.

Mona: (laughs) You got me right good. Help me put it on?

(Walks puts the necklace on her neck)

Walks: There's just one more pressing matter.

Headmaster Bennett: Students! Is there not someplace else for you to be?

Mona: Quickly, what is it?

Walks: Will you go to the prom with me?

Mona: Of course I will!

(They kiss as Headmaster Bennett grunts in disgust.)

Mona: Oh, Walks. You made me so happy that I shall skip for the rest of the day.

(She skips to class as Walks sighs happily, then the bell rings. We fade to Latin class as Walks quickly walks in and sits on his desk.)

Latin Teacher: Slates at the ready for dictation, class. E pluribus unum lorem ipsum sit amet duis lectus quis dui viverra vestibulum...

(A piece of paper flies at Walks as he looks at Gareth, who looks back, then he opens the paper to reveal a note)

Walks: "Friend - The fight is set for Saturday at 8:00 p.m. (Same time as prom) Will you attend?" Gareth, that is the worst possible time!

Gareth: This is the only time that Klorgbane is available. He surprisingly involved in a lot of extra curriculum.

Walks: But this will ruin everything with Mona!

Gareth: You can still take her to the prom. Simply say you have to go to the bathroom and then sneak out for the fight. You can come right back for the -

Latin Teacher: Walks, Gareth, eyes and ears in the front of the room.

Gareth: Behind the auditorium at 8:00. We'll bring the fists.

(Walks groans and checks "yes". We fade to Saturday night where a horse carriage pulls up at Mona's house. Walks licks his hair, walks to the door and knocks. Mona's dad answers it)

Mona's Dad: Well, well, well, you must be Walks.

Walks: That's correct, sir.

Mona's Dad: (calling to Mona) Desdemona, your date's here.

Mona: (offscreen) Be right down!

Mona's Dad: Take your time. You're growing up too fast.

Mona: (offscreen) Dad!

Mona's Dad: Are you new in town, Walks? I don't remember you from Desdemona's earlier classes.

Walks: Uh, no, sir. I just switch schools a lot, because I keep getting expelled.

Mona's Dad: Oh, I see.

Mona's Mom: (offscreen) Here she comes!

(Mona comes downstairs in her prom dress, looking beautiful and still wearing the necklace as romantic music plays)

Walks: Oh, Mona, you wore it!

Mona: I'll always wear it. (Mona's mom comes in and tries to wipe a mole off her face) Mom!

Mona's Mom: Oh, Mona, you just got something on your face. (She licks her finger and wipes the mole off of Mona's face)

Mona: Stop!

Mona's Mom: I just don't want you to look like trash on your prom night!

Walks: She looks beautiful, even with the junk on her face.

Mona: (giggles) Let's go.

(Walks giggles and they walk out the house to the prom)

Mona's Dad: Take good care of her tonight. Don't forget she's someone's little girl!

Mona: Don't mind him, tonight is going to be perfect

(We cut to the school prom)

Headmaster Bennett: Lets keep it clean tonight, Eugene. I don't want a repeat of last year.

(Walks and Mona walk inside the prom)

Mona: Isn't this so magical? I don't mean the bows, But aren't our decorations are not just the epitome of Enchantment Under the Sea?

Walks: Oh, they are. I truly do feel there's someone riding the waves of the dream. (He looks out a window to find the Immortal Student Council as one of them looks at Walks) And I have the entire weight of the ocean upon my shoulders.

Mona: Yes well, we all interpret the theme in our own ways.

Walks: I am sorry Mona, I could use a refreshment. Would you like some refreshment? I will give us some refreshment. (Runs to get punch for her)

Mona: Alright.

(Walks fills up a cup of punch as he looks at the clock and it's almost 8:00, but Walks accidentally overfills the cup, and he walks back to Mona who gives her the cup of punch)

Walks: Here you are, Mona. I drank all mine before I can make it back to you uh, it seems to have made its way through my system at the pace of steam engine. So now I really need to use the bathroom if you'll pardon me again.

Mona: Walks, it's not even remotely possible for Punch to digest that quickly.

Walks: But you see, I...

Mona: (gasps) Do you not absolutely love this song?!

Walks: Uhh...

Mona: ♪Let's dance in style. Let's dance in a while.♪ Come, waltz!

Walks: No, I don't particularly...

Mona: Is this why you've been acting so strange?

Walks: Uh, yes.

Mona: Don't be silly, some of the greatest adventures can be had on the dance floor!

(They slow-dance along with other prom dates as "Forever Young" by Alphaville plays. The Immortal Student Council, Gareth and Klorgbane, who is checking is pocket watch, are waiting outside for Walks' arrival.)

Klorgbane: It is 8:00! Where is my opponent?!

Archibald: Walks will be here.

Reginald: Do not worry.

Gareth: But just in case, I'll go give him a reminder.

(Cut back to Walks and Mona continue slow-dancing)

Walks: ♪I want to be...♪ (sees Gareth knocking on the window)

Mona: What is it, Walks? Is something amiss?

Gareth: WALKS!!!

Walks: No, everything is perfect. I just...

Mona: Oh Walks! The photographer has arrived. Let's pose for a prom portrait! Come on! It only takes 10 minutes.

(They walk to take their prom picture)

Walks: Uhh...

Klorgbane: Enough! If Walks will not come to me, then I will go to him!

Gareth: Klorgbane, no!

(Klorgbane knocks him to the ground. Cut to black, then we cut back to Walks and Mona standing still for their prom picture)

Mona: (trough teeth) Are you sure all is well? I can't help but feel that you are trying to escape.

Walks: (trough teeth) No, of course! I am exactly where I wish to be.

(Klorgbane bursts into the auditorium)

Klorgbane: WALKS!!! (Walks gasps) Did you think I wasn't going to come looking for you?! (He breaks a seahorse prop with his knee) Think you can just be a no show?! (He breaks a jellyfish decoration with his fist)

Mona: Oh!

Klorgbane: Our fight started at 8:00! (He smashes the camera with his fist as the photographer runs away)

Mona: A fight? But Walks...

Walks: It wasn't meant to unfold like this, Mona! I'm sorry!

(He gets to Walks and throws Mona out of the way)

Walks: Mona! Klorgbane!

Klorgbane: (laughs evilly)

Headmaster Bennett: So you're the instigator, Klorgbane! Get out of my school!

Klorgbane: You blind old fool! Don't you see, this is my school! (Shoves Headmaster Bennett to the floor)

Headmaster Bennett: Somebody do something!

Mona: Walks! (Nods her head sadly, allowing Walks to fight Klorgbane)

Walks: KLORGBANE!!

(He runs to Klorgbane and punches him rapidly, but no avail. Klorgbane punches him on the face repeatedly)

Gareth: (holding up the Fists of Justice) Walks, the Fists of Justice!

Walks: Uh, a Little busy right now, Gareth. (He avoids two of Klorgbane's punches)

Archibald: Let me at 'im!

Reginald: Archibald, don't be a hero! Immortal Student Union - and Glee Club.

Immortal Student Council: TALLY-HO!!! (As they fire their rattles and walk to aid Walks)

Reginald: Deliver the fists!

Klorgbane: Fists of Justice, eh? Well, I've been busy in metal shop, too.

(He takes out a black spike with a black rope and red electricity on it, and swings it to hit Walks, but he avoids it. The Immortal Student Council and Gareth get closer to him, but he hits them with his spike, making Gareth drop the fists as everyone runs away. Walks jumps on him, but he grabs Walks and head butts him to the floor.)

Mona: Walks!

(He smashes the table with his spike while Walks avoids it)

Klorgbane: Give it up, Walks!

Walks: Walks never walks away from a bully.

Klorgbane: Don't you see, Walks? I rule this school and everyone in it! You're a fool to challenge me. (chuckles) I've waited a long time for this.

(He aims his spike at Walks, and and is about to hit him with it)

Mona: WALKS!!!

(She pushes Walks out of the way, saving him, as the spike hits the wall, missing him, and it cracks to the ceiling as a piece of it falls on Mona, killing her.)

Walks: MONAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!

Gareth: (grabs the Fists of Justice) Walks, the fists!

(He bangs the fists twice as they fly into towards Walks and he grabs them with his hands. The Immortal Student Council cheers, then Walks runs to Klorgbane as he tries to avoid Walks' punches with his spike stick, but he punches him with the Fists of Justice, sending him flying to the wall. Walks walks to him.)

Klorgbane: No, no more!

Walks: Agreed! No more! No more fear, no more bullying, no more Klorgbane.

(He strikes the final blow on Klorgbane, punching him and sending him to the stratosphere)

Walks: Mona, Mona! (gasps)

(Reginald founds the necklace in the debris as the locket shines, and he and shooks at Walks sadly. He sheds into tears, about to cry.)

Skips (voice-over): She was the only woman I've ever loved.

(We fade to black)

Skips (voice-over; continued): I had a few rough years after that.

(We fade to Adult Walks, Adult Gareth and the Guardians in the Guardians of Eternal Youth's Realm)

Skips (voice-over; continued): And then one day.

Walks: Woah, nice pad.

Reginald: It's not bad. We split rent five ways. Walks, by our calculation, (They Show Walks an image of Klorgbane's orbit heading towards Earth) Klorgbane's orbit will return him to Earth 157 years from now. He will harm other. Brave Walks, will you become immortal and fight him when he returns?

Walks: I'll do it.

Reginald: Immortality has a price. You will outlive your family. You will see loved ones come and go.

Walks: I've already lost the one I loved.

(The guardians nod sadly)

Reginald: Now, choose a name to be reborn on to.

(Walks nods and thinks in his head as an altered version of "Just Can't Get Enough" by Depeche Modes plays in the background. He remembers the memories he and Mona spent time including, Mona's feet skipping in the hallway, the scene from Diary, him and Mona skipping along and Walks' feet skipping)

Walks: I've chosen Skips.

(The guardians grants him immortality as the story ends)

Skips: And that's how I became immortal. I'll skip till the end of the eternity. It's my way of being close to her. (Sips his soda)

Mordecai: (sad-toned) Dude, that was kind of a downer.

Rigby: (sad-toned) And did you even graduate? Cause You didn't even say you- (Mordecai punches him) Ow!

Skips: Well boys, break's over. Go downstairs and grab some more shingles.

(They walk through the window into the attic)

Mordecai: (sighs) Man, I'm so glad I am not immortal.

Rigby: Yeah, man.

Muscle Man: Okay, that's it (takes off his pants)

Mordecai: C'mon Muscle Man, not the pants.

Muscle Man: If I don't take them off, I can't cool 'em off. Simple science, bro.

Benson: Listen up, due to the extreme heat, the park is closed today, work is cancelled. If you need me, I'll be in the shade lying still. (he leaves)

Rigby: Alright. Did you hear that, Mordecai? A day off.

Mordecai: Too bad we don't have air conditioning, and it's too hot to move.

Rigby: Oh yeah. Man, this day off is a scam.

Mordecai: We just have to find a place where we can cool off.

(Scene cuts to the Coffee Shop)

Eileen: So just the free ice water then?

Rigby: Yeah, thanks Eileen. (he cools himself off with the ice water)

Eileen: (stares at Rigby, wide eyed) Feel better now? (she clears her voice) Feel better now, Rigby?

Rigby: No, I'm still hot.

(Eileen takes the shirt)

Eileen: Mordecai and the Rigbys? Whatever happened to that?

Mordecai: We had to break up. Didn't want to end up as British dirtbags, so.

Eileen: That's why I quit Mole Scouts too. Well anyway, if you feel like getting back together, there's a Battle of the Bands here tonight.

Mordecai: Nah, that was a different time.

Rigby: Yeah, things have changed for us.

Eileen: First prize is an air conditioner.

(Mordecai and Rigby gasp)

Mordecai: Where's the sign up sheet?

(Scene cuts to the park where Benson holds up a soda to cool himself off, Skips sitting on a hammock, Pops laying on a chair with a fan to cool himself off, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost laying down on a pool, and Thomas laying down on another chair)

Mordecai: Dudes, dudes. Guess what?

(The guys groan)

Mordecai: There's gonna be a Battle of the Bands tonight.

Muscle Man: Why should we care, bro?

Mordecai: Because the prize is a brand new air conditioner.

(The guys are excited)

Rigby: And we're getting the band back together.

(Mordecai and Rigby are mimicking rock stars who are playing guitars)

Benson: Mordecai and the Rigbys aren't a band. Two guys who can barely play guitar isn't a band.

Mordecai: Hey, we've been practicing.

Rigby: But on your second point, you're right, two guys isn't a band. That's why we need you guys.

Mordecai: Yeah. Pops, keys.

Rigby: Skips, bass.

Mordecai: Muscle Man and Fives, horn.

(Mordecai and Rigby are mimicking drummers)

Mordecai and Rigby: Benson on drums. And...

Mordecai: Uhhh...

Thomas: I know, I can be your British manager.

Mordecai: What?

Thomas: Dude, every band has a mean British manager. (he speaks in British accent) Oi, you lot! (he snickers and again speaks in British accent) We're supposed to play Manchester on half an hour ago!

Mordecai: Uhh...sure, man. So, you guys with us?

Muscle Man: If it means getting out of this heat wave, then we're in!

Guys: AC! AC! AC! AC!

Benson: You guys better know what you're doing!

(Scene cuts to the garage where the guys are setting up the band and playing music)

Mordecai: Guys? Guys?

Thomas (in British accent): Hey, listen up you lot, Mordo here has something to say! (He leaves)

Mordecai: Uhhh...thanks, Thomas. Now we're all in this together and we all have equal say. No one person is in charge, okay?

Benson: Fine! Even though I've actually been in a successful band before.

Rigby: Okay, we need a really awesome tune. Anybody have any song ideas?

Benson: I'm working on a rock opera! It's a little thing I call: Benson-Phonia!

Muscle Man: Benson, no offense but since we're equals now, that sounds totally stupid, bro. No offense!

Mordecai: Actually, I've been working on a riff.

Pops: Let's hear it!

Rigby: Yeah, man! 

Mordecai: Okay, I'm a bit rusty, alright? Okay, okay.

(Mordecai plays a guitar riff, and then the rest of the band plays along with it one at a time.)

Rigby: C'mon, Mordo!

(Mordecai and Rigby plays a short riff)

Mordecai: ♪Sometimes I dream about that AC, AC! Cold waves blowin' over, over me. Feelin' hot maybe it's a state of mind, Think cold to pass the, pass the time! Snowman and, snowstorms,♪

(Scene cuts outside the house)

Benson: Stop, stop, stop! Again! One and-a two and-a three and-a four, (Benson and the band play in unison)

Benson: (points at Muscle Man) You're not blowing hard enough! I mean, really blow! (turns to High Five Ghost) And as for.. (Scene cuts to Benson on the drums)

Benson: You're flat! You're flat! 

Benson: (plays the keyboard to Pops) See how much better that sounds? (takes a listen to Skips on the bass) Skips, you gotta play on tempo!

Benson: (The band plays but interrupted) Again! (The band plays but interrupted again) Again! (The band is interrupted for the third time) AGAIN, AGAIN, AGAIN!

(Scene cuts to the restroom, where the band except for Benson is having a meeting)

Mordecai: Sorry for the weird meeting place, but Benson only allowed one bathroom break and we got some urgent business to take care of. Now, I'm gonna say what everybody else is thinking. We gotta do something about Benson, right?

Skips: He told me my bass playing was sloppy. Me, Skips!

Pops: He told me my arpeggios don't arpeggi-flow! What does that even mean?

Rigby: At this rate, we're never gonna win that AC! And the Battle of the Bands is in a few hours!

Mordecai: Who thinks me and Rigby should run rehearsals? (everybody raises their hands)

Rigby: (flushes the toilet) Meeting adjourned!

(Benson is seen outside of the stalls listening angrily to what they're speaking about)

Mordecai: Alright! Good meet-- (screams as he sees benson)

Benson: I came to check up on you guys. I'm the only one taking this seriously AND YOU BACKSTAB ME LIKE THIS?!!?!!

Mordecai: Uhh...

Benson: WELL, I QUIT!!!!!! (throws drumsticks on the ground)

Mordecai: Good riddance! And don't come back!

(Benson slams the door shut)

Muscle Man: Dude, we need a drummer! Now what?

(They talk in unison and the scene changes to the rehearsals.)

Thomas: One, two, three-

(The band plays badly)

Mordecai: Hey, hey guys! I think we're gotta scrap Keepin' It Cool. (They all groan) It'll be okay, though! I've been working on a new sound that the judges are gonna go nuts for. Okay, so it starts off with a child voice saying: You can't tell me what to do! And then it goes: (plays the guitar, singing) ♪ Used to be a time when you had all the power! But these days, it's more like you are just a jerk! ♪

Rigby: Mordecai!

Mordecai: ♪ And I don't wanna look at your face! ♪

Rigby: MORDECAI!

Mordecai: What?!

Rigby: Listen to yourself! This is not a good song!

Mordecai: Oh, yeah? (grabs Rigby) Then how come this is the song that's gonna take us to the top?!

Rigby: Ahh! (pounds on Mordo's fists) Get off of me!

Muscle Man: Woah, woah! Cool it!

Rigby: You've lost it dude!

Mordecai: Good! (spits) I didn't want it anyway. I quit! (then Mordecai and the rest of the band leave)

Rigby: (sighs and then puts down his guitar)

Eileen: (puts down a pitcher full of water) Is everything okay?

Rigby: I don't know, Eileen. I mean all I wanted to do is win the air conditioner. And now Mordecai and the Rigbys is dead -- again.

Eileen: Yeah, but if anyone can get the band back together, it's you.

Rigby: Me? Why me?

Eileen: You're the one who came up with the band in the first place. You're the one who kept wearing the t-shirt way after it was cool. You're the one who can keep the band alive.

Rigby: Hey, yeah! I can get the band back together! And all I gotta do is lie and say I got free pizza!

(Scene changes to the coffee shop)

Mordecai: (He enters the room) Don't get any ideas. I'm just here to eat my free pizza and go.

(Benson also enters the room, and they both scoff.)

(Rigby closes the door.)

Mordecai: Rigby?!

Benson: What's going on here?

Muscle Man: Yeah where's the free pizza?

Rigby: Okay, look, don't be mad. But there's no free pizza.

Mordecai: I'm out!

Rigby: (blocks the door) But there's a good reason I brought you all here! We can work this out guys, we can still win!

Mordecai: No way, dude! I'm not playing in a band with Benson! (slaps Benson's drum kit)

Benson: Don't touch my kit, Mordecai!

Mordecai: Or what?

Benson: Or.. Or I'll cut your strings!

(Mordecai slaps Benson's drum kit again)

(It ended up in a fight and destroying all their instruments.)

Thomas: (in a British accent) Oy! Just wanted to make sure -- (surprised) krikey.

Mordecai: Oh man, what are we doing?

Rigby: Yeah, we just broke a bunch of stuff!

Muscle Man: I guess I'll never go triple platinum with this baby. (spills soda from his trumpet)

(Everybody laughs)

Mordecai: Ha! I can't believe we let the heat get to us like this. I'm sorry I quit, dude.

Rigby: It's okay, man. This stuff happens when you're in a band.

Mordecai: Yeah, but I forgot what was most important.

Rigby: Friendship?

Mordecai: The air conditioner. You're right though! We can still win this thing. 

Rigby: Okay, except that was something I said before we broke all our instruments.

Mordecai: No! We can still do it! When you're in Mordecai and the Rigbys, the music's inside of you. But we need everybody if we're gonna win. Even the ones we thought were acting like jerks, but are actually pretty good drummers.

(Benson was touched and grabs Mordecai's hand.)

(Scene changes to the stage where performers play songs. The crowd boos at them and the judges rated them "Not Cool".)

Auto T.: Next!

Eileen: What happened back there?

Thomas: Ah, all the instruments are destroyed.

Eileen: What?!

(Mordecai and the Rigbys shows up to the stage)

Eileen: There they are!

(They pretend to put their guitars onto them.)

Man: Hey! Where are your instruments, man?

Mordecai: Shut it!

Mordecai and Rigby: We are Mordecai and the Rigbys!

Mordecai: And we rock so hard, we don't need instruments.

Rigby: Hit it!

Benson: A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four!

(Mordecai, Rigby and the rest of the band do an acapella mimicking the sound of their instruments. Eileen and Thomas were shocked at them.)

Mordecai: Sometimes I dream about ice planted eggs, by distant planet way colder, colder than the rest. That's where Lord Blizzord resides, think about His kingdom to pass the, pass the time. Ice mix and Ice can. There's not much into it,

(Then they glow and virtual instruments started to appear.)

Mordecai: K-k-k-keeping it cool! K-k-k-keeping it cool!

(Rigby plays while laying on the ground.)

Eileen and Thomas: Wooh! Alright, yeah!

Eileen: Man, they sure look gross and sweaty.

(The band keeps playing their imaginary instruments.)

Mordecai: K-k-k-keeping it cool! (The judges rate them: "Cool".) K-k-k-keeping it cool! (They play until there's a large text above them that says: Keeping it Cool. Then Lord Blizzord gets out of the air conditioner.

Mordecai: Lord Blizzord!

(Lord Blizzord blows a blizzard onto them.)

(Scene changes to the hospital and Mordecai and the rest of the band was there.)

Mordecai: Huh? We won!

Eileen: Actually, you guys collapsed of heat stroke before you even started.

(Flashbacks to what really happened on the stage.)

Mordecai: (weakly) We don't even need instruments!

Benson: One, two, three! (He collapses)

(Mordecai and Rigby mimic the sounds shortly and also collapse. The crowd boos at them and the judges then rate them: "Not Cool".)

Eileen: You actually got last place. Your subconscious must have created a reality where you're really good. You're in a hospital now.

Rigby: But dude, free AC!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woaaahhhh! (then they shiver because of cold)

Mordecai:  Can we get some --- extra blankets?

Mordecai: Wooooooaaaahh! I beat the whole game without even taking a hit.

Rigby: I could have done that.

(Pops comes in)

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, hello! Would you two mind picking up a painting for me today?

Rigby: Yeah sure, that sounds fun.

Mordecai: What's the occasion, Pops?

Pops: Tonight's the Hall of Park Managers' annual celebration, (Shows the picture) and Benson is being honored.

Rigby: Wow, they have a hall for everything these days.

Pops: Hmph, yes, all the greatest park managers in the tri-county area have been represented there.

Mordecai: This sounds like kind of a big deal, are you sure you want us to do it?

Pops: Of course! I trust you. Benson's portrait is at the local gallery. (Shows another picture) Here is there information.

(Rigby grabs the information)

Mordecai: We won't let you down, Pops.

Pops: See you at the celebration. (Starts running, laughing, and throwing all the papers)

Mordecai & Rigby: Picking up a portrait!

(We skip the scene to see Gallery Chic. The camera zooms in to see the lady about to close the door)

Mordecai: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! (Takes a deep breath) Hi. Sorry we're late, we're here to pick up a painting.

Paint Manager: I was wondering when you'd show up.

(We skip to Mordecai and Rigby walking back to the house. Mordecai is carrying Benson's portrait while Rigby is carrying a hot pretzel.)

Rigby: So, no one's seen this painting yet?

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: You know, we could see this painting yet.

Mordecai: Nope.

Rigby: Aw, come on! You went to art school. Don't you want to see Benson, like, interpreted or look at the paint... composition?

Mordecai: Well, I guess that could be kinda cool.

Rigby: (Goes to rip open the painting's protective wrapping paper) Sweet! Let's rip her open.

Mordecai: Whoa, dude. You're not going near it with that pretzel.

Rigby: My hands are clean. Check it out. One finger holds the pretzel while the others do what I want. See, that's why pretzels are the perfect food. They got handles.

(The pretzel slips out of Rigby's hand and slides down Benson's exposed portrait, to which Rigby gasps)

Mordecai: Oh no, dude. Oh no, dude! OH NO, DUDE! Wipe it off!

(Rigby tries to wipe it off, which only makes a bigger mess)

Mordecai & Rigby: Aaah!

Rigby: We just ruined Benson's face for Benson's face thing!

Mordecai: We're fired. That's it! We're fired!

Rigby: You're the art guy. Make us not fired!

Mordecai: Okay. The party's in seven hours. (Begins to think of a plan) Hmm. Hmm. Hmmmmmm. Hmm, hmm. Yup. I'm going to repaint this thing.

Rigby: Sweet! Let's get this arty started!

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOOOOOOH!!

(The scene transitions back to the park house. Mordecai grabs a box labelled 'Mordo's art stuff' and coughs. He then sets up a canvas and tries to decide how he wants to paint Benson's portrait.)

Mordecai: Okay, Benson. Benson. Okay... Benson.

Rigby: Ugh! Come on, just start already!

Mordecai: I'm trying!

Rigby: When was the last time you actually drew something?

Mordecai: It's a process, man. In art school they taught us to really explore the subject and take time to really understand the deeper meaning.

(Rigby makes an obnoxious fart noise in response)

Rigby: Come on, this is Benson. It's not hard. Move. (He begins to paint on the blank canvas) Watch. He's round, angry, red... big ol' face. Whatever, done. Perfect. (A sloppily-drawn Benson is revealed)

Mordecai: Dude, that's way worse.

Rigby: At least I did something.

Mordecai: Augh. I just can't concentrate with you here watching me.

Rigby: Fine, but you better have something done when I get back. (He goes to leave)

Mordecai: I will! Once I, like, get the lights right, and the paint's gotta set... wait for the gesso to dry...

(Rigby slams the storm doors on his way out)

Mordecai: Alright. (Claps his hands) Time to get to business. (Claps again) Just gotta... (Fiddles with a radio) pick the right tunage. 

(We then skip to much later in the day. Rigby returns with a hot pretzel)

Rigby: So, how's it going?

Mordecai: Dude, another hot pretzel?

Rigby: Of course another hot pretzel. This is who I am, now. Deal with it. (Eats the pretzel) Alright, let me have a look.

Mordecai: Uh, naw. (Quickly blocks the painting) It's not ready yet.

Rigby: Come on, I wanna see! (Pulls Mordecai out of the way)

Mordecai: It's a work in progress. 

(The camera zooms in to the same creepy-drawn painting from before)

Rigby: Dude, you literally haven't done anything!

Mordecai: I said it's a work in progress!

Rigby: (Sighs) Seriously, Mordecai, what's the hold up? Hungry? Thirsty? Didn't graduate and are a huge loser?

Mordecai: (Groans) No, it's not that.

Rigby: Well, what is it, then?

Mordecai: It's just... uhh... (Rigby motions for him to continue) Alright, look. Whenever I drew portraits in college, they always went badly. They'd always misinterpret it, or get offended, and it was just tough because... ugh, whatever. I just can't do portraits.

Rigby: It's okay, dude. I'm sure you can conquer your fear. You really want to let down that face? (Rigby gestures to his sloppy drawing of Benson, and Mordecai laughs) I believe in ya, man.

Mordecai: Alright, I'm gonna try a trick that always worked in art school. (He puts a tape on. The words 'Painting is Great with Benny Harris' appear.)

Benny: Oh. Hey there, fellow painters, Benny Harris here. And today I'll be showing you how to make some beautiful little portraits. 

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai finally attempting to paint Benson's portrait)

Benny: And sometimes, we just gotta take our accidents and make them a little more chipper. Cheer up there, little moustache! Now that's a pleasant little mustache we just painted.

Mordecai: Hmm. Hmm, hmm.

Benny: And do you know why?

Mordecai: Mm-mm.

Benny: Cause I pictured it in my mind's eye. (The hedgehog on his shoulder chirps in response, and he laughs) Penelope sure does love it when I get existential.

Mordecai: Mind's eye. (Sighs)

(Mordecai then has a flashback of when he was still in art school. A young woman comes up to him.)

Woman: Hey! (Mordecai looks up) So you're, like, an artist?

Mordecai: Yeah. I mean, I'm in art school, so... (Laughs)

Woman: So, could you, like, draw me?

Mordecai: Oh, yeah, sure. (Quickly draws her and shows her the picture. As soon as the woman sees it, she runs away crying. Mordecai groans loudly in response.)

(The scene then cuts back to the present, where Mordecai is groaning in the exact same manner)

Benny: Relax. The human mind can be a spooky place full of all your fears, memories, and secrets. Focus on that there subject.

Mordecai: Okay, okay.

(We then get another glimpse into Mordecai's mind, where he is still picturing the girl crying. He groans in concentration and he is able to replace the crying woman with Benson.)

Benson: Hi, I'm Benson. Your boss, former drummer, stick hockey enthusiast.

Mordecai: Yeah, yeah. Yeah! (He begins to paint, only to create a cubist painting) Uh, ooooh.

(The camera then pans over to Skips and Benson, who are talking outside)

Skips: Benson, you excited for the party tonight?

Benson: Yeah! It feels really good to be given this huge honor. I can't wait.

(Rigby walks in)

Rigby: Hey man, how's it going? I assume everything's aweso-ooooooh!

Mordecai: Ugh. This is horrible. I can't show this to Benson. (He then hears Benny say something and turns his attention to the TV)

Benny: Now I know our mind's eye can sometimes get a little messy. When my thoughts get clogged up, I find taking some slides really inspires my creative flow.

Mordecai: Dude, that's it! I just need some reference.

(Rigby pulls out a camera)

Rigby: I'm on it! (He runs outside)

(We then cut back to Benson and Skips talking)

Benson: Yeah, I mean, Audrey and I aren't really calling it a date... (Rigby starts taking pictures) Rigby, what are you doing? Stop! Stop it! Get out of my face with that camera or you're fired! (Rigby stops taking pictures and rushes back to Mordecai)

Rigby: Alright, let's go get these babies developed.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai and Rigby back at the park)

Rigby: Okay, let's see what we got here. (Turns on a projector and flips through all the photos he took) Nice. Cool. Woah!

Mordecai: Rigby, I can't use any of these.

Rigby: He moves around a lot, got all that nervous energy.

Mordecai: Augh! 

Rigby: Come on, you got all you need here! (Flips through the photos again) His face, hands, feet, that's his, you know, his butt, that's an important element.

Mordecai: (Sighs) Yeah. I guess I can piece it together. (Starts painting)

Rigby: You're doing it!

Mordecai: Dude, don't jinx it. (Goes back to painting)

(Rigby's phone suddenly rings)

Rigby: Hey, Pops.

Pops: Yes, hello, Rigby. It's Pops, your friend Pops from the park. Say, I must ask, where's the portrait? We're all waiting.

Rigby: Oh, it's going great, gonna be great, everyone's gonna love it! (Mordecai tries to silence Rigby with hand motions) I think the artists really had some breakthroughs. Get your hopes way, way up! We'll be there soon, very soon. (He hangs up)

Mordecai: Dude, why'd you say all that?

Rigby: It's true, right? You gotta be done by now.

Mordecai: No, I still gotta fix the-

Rigby: There's no time! I'm sure it's fine!

Mordecai: Seriously, it's not ready yet. And keep that stupid pretzel away from it!

Rigby: I'm sorry, but seriously, we have to go now!

Mordecai: But they're gonna hate it! No! (He ends up pushing Rigby, whose hot pretzel sauce ends up getting all over the projector)

Rigby: Hmm. Something weird normally happens when that happens. (He then slips and spills his cheese sauce on the projector) Oh no, my dipping sauce!

(Mordecai and Rigby are seen coughing as something emerges from the projector)

Mordecai: What is that? (More objects begin to emerge) Dude, are those your horrible slides? 

(A Benson slide then leaps up and latches onto a pipe)

Benson Butt Slide: We're horrible? You call this art? (He shows Mordecai his painting)

Mordecai: What do you mean?

Benson Butt Slide: This portrait looks nothing like me!

Mordecai: Yeah it does! I mean, kinda.

Benson Butt Slide: You've ruined everything!

Benson Face Slide: Destroy the painting!

(Another Benson slide begins to climb up Mordecai's leg)

Mordecai: Aaah!

(Rigby begins hitting the Benson slides with Mordecai's painting)

Rigby: No! Mordecai is good at art! (A Benson slide goes through a paper shredder)

Benson Face Slide: Rigby's not an artist! You can't trust his opinion!

Mordecai: He's my friend! (Kicks the slide)

Benson Face Slide: Exactly! (Crawls back over towards Mordecai)

(Rigby is shown running away with the painting)

Benson Butt Slide: Give me that cubic trash! (Rigby screams and flings the slide, which lands back on top of him)

Rigby: Mordecai, there's no time! We have to get to the party!

(Mordecai grabs a pipe and uses it to remove the Benson slide from his leg)

Rigby: Their punches are like papercuts!

(Three Benson slides attack Rigby. Mordecai goes to get rid of them, but another slide jumps onto the pipe he's holding.)

Benson Big Hand Slide: You're just another slacker that went to art school to feel like he accomplished something!

(Mordecai flings the slide into the TV, which activates Benny Harris's ghost)

Mordecai & Rigby: Benny Harris!

Benny: Well, hey there!

Mordecai: What should we do?

Benny: I always say use what you see in your mind's eye.

Mordecai: (Kicks a Benson slide) Dude, that didn't work!

Benny: Who cares? What's more important is that you made something. That's more than most people can say. Look at that guy. He probably never made anything in his life.

Rigby: Hey! (A Benson slide punches him in the face)

Mordecai: But the painting's all wrong! I messed it up! Now Benson's night is gonna be ruined.

Benny: Well, sometimes we gotta take our accidents and make them a little more chipper. (Holds up a paintbrush)

Mordecai: But how does that stop the Bensons?

Benny: Ugh, just paint over them. They're slides!

Mordecai: Oh, cool. (Walks over to a can of paint)

Benson Blob Slide: Might as well just give up now. You couldn't use a paintbrush to save your life!

Mordecai: Well then I won't use a paintbrush. (He dunks his fist in the paint can)

(He throws a ball of paint at the slide, which eliminates it. Rigby gasps in admiration. Mordecai then punches another slide, which sends paint flying onto the canvas. The shredded Benson slide climbs onto Rigby, who dives into another can of paint. He shakes the paint off like a dog and eliminates another Benson slide that is crawling towards him.)

Benson Butt Slide: You're making a mess! Clean it up or you're fired!

(Mordecai throws Rigby at the slide, which then ultimately ends up eliminating it when Rigby rams into the projector screen. Benny whistles in awe.)

Rigby: We did it!

Mordecai: Thanks for your help, Benny Harris's ghost, or hologram, or astral projection, or whatever.

Benny: No problamo! Don't be a stranger now, and remember to rewiiiiiiind! (He gets sucked back into the tape)

Mordecai: How does it look? (Rigby shows him the painting) Uhhh.... wait. Help me flip it over. Good enough. Let's roll.

(We skip to the Hall of Park Managers)

 Host: And now, we welcome our newest member! Mr. Pops, would you please present the portrait?

(Pops murmurs nervously)

Benson: You didn't have Mordecai and Rigby do it, did you? 

Pops: Well...

(Mordecai and Rigby burst through the doors. Everyone gasps in shock.)

Host: Who are those two? This is most unusual.

Mordecai: We brought the painting. And... we're sorry. We messed it up. (Benson turns red) But I tried to... well, I hope you like it anyway. Sorry if it isn't what you wanted. (Rigby unveils it, and everyone complains. Benson and Pops gasp in shock.) Uh... dude, flip it over! (Rigby flips it over, and everyone in the audience starts to applaude) I understand if you want to fire me.

Benson: Fire you? I think it's great! The brush work, the composition, the raw energy perfectly captured my misunderstood personality. You're actually a really great artist, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Thanks.

Host: Uh yes, yes, I love it too. But I'm sorry; this abstract, unconventional piece just isn't appropriate for a hall setting. We'll have to commission a new portrait.

Rigby: You're not even going to use Mordecai's cool one?

Benson: That's okay. I know just the place for it.

(We cut back to the park house, where Benson is writing something at his desk. The painting is hanging behind him. Suddenly, it falls down, and Benson sighs.)

Benson: Why did I have Mordecai and Rigby hang it?

Mr. Murphy: So for your final project, I thought we'd do something fun - a music video! (the class cheers except for Eileen, who is unsure) Projects are due at the end of the week. Good luck!

(Everyone leaves, then Eileen walks up to Mr. Murphy's desk)

Eileen: Um, Mr. Murphy, what exactly are you looking for in the assignment? I wanna do a good job so I can pass the class.

Mr. Murphy: Don't ask me what I'm looking for, Eileen, ask you what you're looking for, in here. Because making a good film takes more than what you have up here.

(Scene cuts to the Coffee Shop)

Mordecai: No way, name me one remake that's better than the original.

CJ: Uh, hello, obviously "Summer Camp Slashdown"? The original was totally shot in some guy's backyard.

Mordecai: What? That was a prequel, not a remake.

CJ: Your face is a remake.

Rigby: Ohhh... burned!

Mordecai: That doesn't even make sense.

(Eileen runs up to the guys)

Eileen: Hey, guys. Refills? Refills?

Mordecai: Eileen, that's the third time you topped us off.

Rigby: Yeah, what gives?

Eileen: Well, there's kind of this favor I wanted to ask you guys. Look, I gotta make a music video for my introductory filmmaking class, which I only took because I required to graduate. But I don't know the first thing about this kind of stuff. You guys are so creative! Can you help me?

Rigby: Can we be in it?

Eileen: Sure!

Rigby: Aw, yeah, we can help!

Mordecai: Yeah, we watch tons of music videos. We know all about this stuff.

CJ: That sounds like a lot of fun, Eileen.

Eileen: Well, super. I'm so glad you guys are up for it. I figured this kind of thing was up in your alley anyway.

Mordecai and Rigby: Psht!

Rigby: You'll be getting an automatic A with us helping you out.

Mordecai: Automatic A!

Mordecai and Rigby: (rapping) Automatic A, Gonna blow your class away, automatic A, let the teacher say hey! (They laugh)

(Scene cuts to the park where Eileen puts down the film camera gear and the guys are set up for the music video)

Eileen: Alright. I may not know much about music videos, but from what I gathered, the coolest ones have dancing in them. And it just so happens I've put together a little routine. (turns on music) So follow my lead. Five, six, seven, eight! (Everyone follows) Step, step, reach, and up!

CJ: (screws up) Aw, man!

Eileen: No, you're getting it! Keep going! (They kept going, which Eileen applauded to. Next Mordecai made a mistake, then immediately corrects it. Then Eileen gave him a thumbs up.)

Eileen: Okay now, step to your left. Arm, arm, jump! (Rigby messes up) Left! Left!

Rigby: Oh, the other left.

Eileen: There's only one left, Rigby.

Rigby: I got it! I got it! (They continued dancing)

Eileen: Alright, you guys are nailing it! I think we're ready to record. (Sets up her tripod)

Mordecai: Wait, you're gonna film here?

Eileen: (Opens up her camera screen) Yeah, why?

Mordecai: The park's just...

Rigby: So boring!

Eileen: I like the park! There's a simple charm.

Mordecai: I guess. But when you be cooler on, I don't know, a mountain top?

Rigby: Or on the back of a moving truck?

Mordecai: Or both at once?

Rigby: And it's on fire! (Imitates the sound of a fire)

Mordecai: We'd still do your dance. Just in for something awesome. Either way it's totally up to you.

CJ: Sounds fun!

Eileen: Well...

(Scene changes to a mountain)

Eileen: Woah, you guys were right! What an impressive vista.

CJ: Yeah. Good call, guys!

Rigby: Good call is what I'm all about.

Mordecai: Like that good call you made when you ate that sandwich off a sidewalk?

Rigby: Hey, the sidewalk adds flavor.

CJ: So did portable toilets. (Laughs)

Rigby: Ohhh... Burn!

Eileen: Alright, places! (She presses the record button on the camera, throws her cap, plays music and then joins them to dance.)

Rigby: Wait, wait. Stop, stop!

Eileen: What's wrong?

Rigby: Woah! Idea. Lightning bolt like, right here! Check it. We keep dancing, but the background keeps changing! Boom! The Arctic, boom! A volcano, boom! Outer space!

Mordecai: Dude, you just blew my mind!

Eileen: That sounds really complicated.

Rigby: Eh, just fix it in post.

CJ: Do you even know what that means?

Rigby: No, but they say it all the time in those making-up documentaries.

Mordecai: You're good at technical stuff, Eileen. It can't be that hard.

Eileen: Alright. If you think I can do it, then let's go for it!

Rigby: Yeah! Up high, Eileen! (He tries to hi-five Eileen but she falls to the ground)

(Scene changes to the seashore, where Mordecai and Rigby are seen wearing costumes, playing guitars and dancing to the music while Eileen films them both.)

Eileen: Cut! Cut! (Mordecai and Rigby stopped dancing) Uhh, what are you guys wearing?

Rigby: Costumes! All the coolest music videos have 'em.

Mordecai: Too much? Too much?

Eileen: Well, yeah! You both look insane.

Mordecai: Hey, sometimes you gotta go in-sane to out-sane the sane. You know what I'm sane-in'?

Eileen: No! Look, I think we should just keep it simple. Less is more is the way to go.

Rigby: Why not go more is more?

CJ: Won't it look weird with just you two in costumes?

Mordecai: We're way ahead of you.

(Scene changes to them wearing different costumes)

Eileen: How do you even dance in this?

Mordecai: Anyway you can!

Eileen: (sighs) Okay. Once more. From the top. Five, six, seven, eight!

Rigby: (holds a zebra head in a different voice) Hi, Eileen!

Eileen: (screams) Cut! The heck is that?

Rigby: Genuine zebra head! Don't worry, it's not real. (Bangs the zebra head)

Eileen: Rigby, I don't think we need props.

Rigby: (gasps and whispers) Don't listen to her!

Mordecai: Look, why don't we just try a couple of takes with props? And if you don't like it, you can just take it out later. No biggie!

Rigby: Though you would be taking out the most awesome part of the video.

Eileen: I don't know.

CJ: Look, Eileen, this is your project. Is this what you want? (Rigby waves the zebra head)

Eileen: Yes! Well, no. I mean, it's not what I thought. But I guess it's cool.

Rigby: (puts the zebra head on Eileen and she screams) Sub! Props to the props! (Eileen sighs)

(Scene changes to them dancing to different costumes. Then everybody plays their role while shooting their video.)

(Scene changes again to Eileen's house, where she is seen driving home.)

Eileen: (sighs) (her phone rings and she answers) What's up?

CJ: Hey! Just wanted to make sure you're okay. You seemed kinda frazzled back at the video shoot.

Eileen: Well, maybe a little. Mordecai and Rigby have a lot of ideas.

CJ: Just don't let them steamroll you, okay?

Eileen: Oh, it's fine. My friend Marcus from class is coming over to help me edit tonight.

CJ: (through the phone) Cool! Well, good luck! (Eileen hangs up then gets out of her car finding out Mordecai and Rigby are in her front door.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Surprise! (Eileen is startled)

Eileen: What are you guys doing here?!

Mordecai: We're here to help you edit.

Eileen: But I already have a friend coming by to help me.

Mordecai: Oh, that dude Marcus? We sent him home.

Rigby: Yeah, we even gave him a slice of this pizza we brought. It's the good stuff, Poppa Greazeos!

Mordecai: No need to thank us.

Eileen: Look, my project is due tomorrow morning. I don't have much time.

Mordecai: Exactly! Three people will make you go faster than one.

Rigby: We'll crank this Poppy up in no time! (Opens and closes up the pizza box like a mouth and talks in a weird voice) Come on, Eileen, I'm getting cold, let me in and eat me!

Eileen: Alright.

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooh! Edit! Edit! Edit! Edit! Edit! Edit!

Eileen: (sits in front of her computer) Let me just open Edit Max Pro. I think there's some cool features in here!

Rigby: What's a star wipe? (Eileen double-clicks the transition feature)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah!

Mordecai: We gotta use that.

Eileen: I don't think we really need it, do we?

Mordecai: Oh, we need the star wipe.

Rigby: We totally need the star wipe.

Eileen: (sighs) Look, let's just get started.

(They began editing. Mordecai and Rigby points out many different transitions and effects on the computer. Then Eileen decides to go for some sleep.)

(Doorbell rings)

CJ: (holds two cups of coffee) Morning!

Eileen: CJ? What are you doing here?

CJ: I wanted to see how the video turned out.

Eileen: Oh no! Is it tomorrow today? I still have to finish it!

Mordecai: No you don't, cause we're done!

Eileen and CJ: You are?

Rigby: It just finished rendering!

Mordecai: Alright. Get ready to have your minds blown! (Plays the video clip, and at the end it displays: FIN.)

CJ: Um...

Rigby: Ugh! Who made this garbage?

Mordecai: Dude, we did!

Rigby: Oh, yeah. I knew we should've used more zebra.

Eileen: This is terrible! I can't turn this in!

CJ: I thought you guys knew everything about music videos.

Rigby: Yeah! Watching them, not making them!

Mordecai: Eileen, I hate to say this, but you probably gonna fail. (the voice lowers down as the camera zooms in to Eileen)

Eileen: I-- I've never failed a class in my life!

Rigby: Eh, it gets easier after the first few times. (Eileen sighs and bangs her head on the table)

Mordecai: Sorry, Eileen.

Rigby: Yeah, sorry we messed this up for you.

CJ: Well, there's still an hour left. We can re-edit it?

Eileen: Re-editing this isn't gonna make it work. Ugh! Think Eileen, Think! (Flashbacks to Mr. Murphy)

Mr. Murphy: (flashback) Don't ask me what I'm looking for, Eileen, ask you what you're looking for, in here. (turns back to the present)

Eileen: There's only one way I can make this work: Eileen's way! (sets up the filming gear, then puts on her cap) Alright, this is what we're gonna do: We're gonna stick to the dance routine like I planned, and we're gonna shoot it all in one take! Without stopping for anything!

Rigby: But that's impossible!

Eileen: No, it isn't! I did the math and it's totally possible. Just dance from here. (everybody smiles) Now, places! (presses the record button) action!

(They dance to the music with different effects and backgrounds. At the end, it is then shown the video is being played back on a TV in the coffee shop.)

Mordecai: So how'd you do?

Eileen: (puts down a paper that shows Eileen got an A from the class) Automatic A!

Mordecai, Rigby and CJ: Woaaahh!

Eileen: No, A. (Everybody says: A!!!!!!!!!!!!)

CJ: Hey, Mordo! You comin'? The back of this bike is not going to ride itself!

Mordecai: Comin'! (Mordecai runs out of his room)

(We cut into a montage of Mordecai and CJ doing different activities. Mordecai and CJ are first seen riding the tandem bike. Second, they're seen rollerskating. CJ makes Mordecai look away so she can get ahead of her. Third, they go to the Community College to paint pictures. They both draw each other very poorly, and they laugh it off. Fourth, they go to a restaurant called Nesbit's Burgers & Bits. They both order a burger with many different condiments; including a slice of pizza, a couple scoops of ice cream, and several gummy worms. Mordecai and CJ both take a bite on the count of three. They immediately spit it out because of the horrible taste , and they laugh it off. Lastly, they're seen doing donuts in the golf cart. Mordecai and CJ are seen walking on a dirt path in the park.)

Mordecai: This day was awesome!

CJ: Yeah. I had a good time.

Mordecai: Do you want to come and watch X-Treme Barista with me and Rigby?

CJ: I can't. I gotta go to work. But I'll be able to watch it there. Hey, text me, and it will be like we're watching it at the same time.

Mordecai: Heh. Phones are awesome.

CJ: Yeah, they are! Alright, I gotta go. Gimme a hug, you loser.

(Mordecai and CJ give each other a hug)

Mordecai: Later.

CJ: See ya. (Clock transition to the house)

Announcer: (on TV)  Today, on X-Treme Barista, K-K-K-Kid Crunchy Z!

Kid Crunchy Z: Yo, yo, yo! I ain't come to here to make friends, I came here to make blends, dawg! So Yuji better watch what's up!

Yuji: (considering his name, he has an Asian accent, and he does) Yo, you see that? Well these three golden barista awards prove that Yuji is number one! So whats he gotta say to that?!

(We now see Mordecai and Rigby sitting in the living room)

Rigby: (excitedly) Man, Yuji is gonna French press this guy!

Mordecai: Pfft! (Modecai is on his phone texting to CJ. He writes "Are you watching xtreme barista? hilarious!" While doing so, he says exactly what he's writing. Mordecai pushes "SEND", and the message is sent. CJ responds by saying "Haha yes! So bad it's good!") Haha. "So bad, it's good." She's so funny.

Announcer: (on TV) One minute begins now. He's adding an energy drink!

(Kid Crunchy Z is seen adding a can of "Thunder Jolto" in a pan.)

Mordecai: Haha.

Rigby: (frustrated) Ugh! All you do is text CJ. Just tell her you like her and quit Pulling a Mordecai.

Mordecai: What?! That's not a thing!

Rigby: (grunting wimpishly, while shaking his arms) "I'm Mordecai, I never make a move, (looking at his hands) And I don't know what to do with my hands". You've been doing this for years.

Mordecai: I'm not like that with CJ!

Rigby: So how come you aren't dating yet?

Mordecai: 'Cause we're just friends. Not every girl I hang out with has to be a potential girlfriend.

Rigby: Shut your excuse hole! Yuji's on.

(Yuji is adding swan-shaped foam into a cup of coffee.)

Yuji: Ain't nobody can make a swan-esspresso like Yuji can! (goes to an athlete) Care for a sip? (athlete leans in, but Yuji swipes away) You don't drink from the cup! You drink from the sky! (throws coffee in the air, pulls out a gun and shoots it) Still warm.

Rigby: Wow!

Mordecai: Hahaha. (looks at his phone and reads) "Cappuccino he di-dnt!" (types) "I like Yuji".

Announcer: Uh-oh!

(Auto correct to "you hi" appears on the phone. Cops are next to Yuji.)

Yuji: Is this some kind of Yuji psyche?! (releases himself and goes to the camera) Yuji will return, yo! Buy my book, suckers! (cops beat him down)

Mordecai: Hahahahaha. (In slow motion, Rigby cries "Yuji!" and Mordecai continues laughing as he sends the message. He looks down and sees it) Whaaa?! No, no, no! Cancel, cancel, cancel! (The message is sent. Mordecai groans)

Rigby: Ugh, what now? My favourite barista probably has rabies and you're—Woah. What happened?

Mordecai: I texted CJ "I like yuji", but it auto-corrected to "I like you hi". (Mordecai and Rigby look in shock as CJ types.) "I like you too. Hi." Wait, what? Aw, no. What am I gonna do?

Rigby: Destroy the phone with acid. That makes the text go away.

Mordecai: What? That's not gonna work. I'm gonna have to ask some real people. (We see him in his and Rigby's room) So that's what happened. How do I tell CJ that I don't "like" like her, I just like her, you know?

(Muscle Man, Skips, Fives and Thomas are in the room.)

Skips: So you pulled a Mordecai, huh?

Mordecai: What the—Come on! How long have you been calling it that?

Muscle Man: How long have you been Mordecai?

(Muscle Man, Fives and Skips act like Mordecai when he's around girls, then laugh. Rigby laugh and Mordecai punches him.)

Rigby: Owww!

Mordecai: Ugh! Come on, what should I do?

Skips: Tell her the truth.

Mordecai: Hmmm, hmmm. Thomas?

Thomas: Well, my second girlfriend liked dancing, but my fourth girlfriend was more into the DJ scene. So, uh, try, try that.

Mordecai: Okay, not really sure why you're on this panel. Muscle Man?

Muscle Man: One word, bro: Cellphone thief.

Mordecai: Huh? (Muscle Man takes his phone) Hey!

(Muscle Man dials CJ's number.)

CJ: Hey, Mordecool.

Muscle Man: (in deeper voice) This isn't Mordecai. This is a common criminal. I've been stealing phones and texting people "I like you hi" all day.

CJ: I know it's you, Muscle Man. What are you doing with Mordecai's phone?

Muscle Man: Uhh...(makes police siren noises) Cops are coming, gotta go! (hangs up and gives back Mordecai's phone) Sorry, bro. That always works on Starla.

Mordecai: Ok, any more advice?

Hi Five Ghost: Well, you'd have to wait 4 years, but-

Mordecai: Ok, anything I can actually do? (everyone except Rigby groans and walk out) That was a dead end.

Rigby: Ugh! Just talk to her already so we don't have to do this all day! I have my own life, you know. I got this book-signing thing I wanna go to.

(A commericial appears on their TV.)

Announcer: Yuji will be at Books, Zines and In-Betweenz signing his new book, "P.S I Love Yuji" today!

Rigby: See?

Mordecai: That's it! Yuji. I'll get a picture of me and Yuji and I'll send it to CJ and write "I like you hi". Then I'll send "Oops, I like Yuji. Dumb autocorrect". Then she'll know my first text was a mistake and her feelings won't get hurt. We'll be able to keep being friends and my life won't be ruined.

Rigby: Whoo, that's bad. That's like one of my plans. (they both walk out) You're lucky I'm going there anyway. Just don't make look bad in front of Yuji.

(Cut to Books, Zines and In-Betweenz.)

Yuji: And that was the day....i lost my innocence. (wipes tear and puts on glasses) At making coffee! Not at making out with girls! I did that waaay earlier...(wide view) to the extreme! (light and smoke appear. Rigby claps. They walk up to him) Sup, Yuji fans.

Rigby: (puts his book on the table) It's an honour to meet you, sir. (Yuji signs the book)

Mordecai: Yeah, uh, huge fan.

Yuji: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. No problem.

Mordecai: Actually, I need a favor. You see, Yuji, I sent a text about you to this girl-

Yuji: And my name auto-corrected to "you hi"?

Mordecai: Uh, yeah. How did you know?

Yuji: (stands up) It's the only reason I'm not famous! If people could viral market by texting about me, I wouldn't be signing books! I would be signing diamonds!

Mordecai: Um, yeah.

Yuji: "Um, yeah" is right, bro! I went to this tattoo shop and check out what happened. (reveals a tattoo on his back that says "You Hi")

Mordecai: Hmm. So can I get a picture with you to show what I was texting about?

Yuji: Let me check my planner. (we see a reminder under Tuesday 15 that says "Buy more planners?") I think I can pencil you in.

Mordecai: Awesome! Where do you want to take the picture?

Yuji: Ohhh, we can take it anywhere extreme!

Mordecai: Um....How about the roof?

Yuji: Can I base-jump off it afterwards?

(Cut to the three of them on the roof.)

Rigby: (setting the phone) Ok. Ready?

Yuji: (blocking his head) Ugh, the glare from the sun is too extreme.

Mordecai: I thought you liked thing extreme.

Yuji: Not when it comes to white balance, bro! We gotta wait for that cloud to float over and block that sun.

(text message sounds)

Rigby: Hey, you got a text from CJ. It says "I get off work in half an hour - text me then."

Mordecai: Ugh! We're running out of time.

Yuji: Ok, so picture won't work. Let me text this X-treme-Anita. (takes phone)

Mordecai: Uhh...

Yuji: "Sup, this is Yuji, blowin' up your call brick!" Sendo! (the "Yuji" is revealed to have corrected to "you hi") Ex-sqeeze me? (types) Re-sendo! (message has the same result) Urrgh! What the extreme?! Stupid phone! I can't even send my own name! Ooooh, I hate myself! (drops phone) I'm such a loser. (kneels) I never should have changed my name from Eugene Mendalman.

Mordecai: (picks up his phone) Let me try. (starts texting) I can still fix this. (show that he sent "That was the real You hi!") Ugh, come on! (texts again) Send! (same message) Aaaaaaah!

Rigby: Dude, chill!

Mordecai: (texting) Maybe if I type "you hi", it'll auto-correct to "yuji" (multi-sends "you hi" to CJ) Send! Send! (phone in violation) Whaaaa-

(Mordecai's phone sucks himself and Rigby into it as they scream. Yuji stands up.)

Yuji: I guess warping into a phone is kind of extreme.

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby transported to a familiar place.)

Mordecai: Whaa...? What's going on? What are we doing here?

Answering Machine: Welcome to the Virtual Messaging-- What the—Is that you, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Oh...hey...hey guys...how have you been?

Answering Machine: Oh, you know. Oh, hey our band put out a demo tape. (shows Mordecai demo tape)

Mordecai: Oh, cool.

(The tape name is "fax me gently" by "Phoning in In")

Answering Machine: It's sort of an ambient prog-rock fusion. You can keep that.

Tin Cans with String: We had to move on after you didn't call.

Mordecai: Uh, that's alright-

Answering Machine: Enough reminiscing! You stand accused of breaking the golden rule of texting—sending the same text message three times.

Tin Cans with String: And that's the worst thing in the world.

Mordecai: What? Why?

Answering Machine: It's super annoying.

(Chalkboard writes "and Lame!")

Tin Cans with String: Yes. And some of us have very limited data plans.

Rigby: Uh, well, he's really sorry.

Mordecai: I'm really sorry!

Rigby: It won't happen again, so if you could just show us the way out--

Smoke Signal Fire: Burn them!

Answering Machine: (sighs) But he's right. This is your second offense! You won't be getting off so easy this time.

Mordecai: I just pressed the wrong button.

Tin Cans with String: You don't press the wrong button three times in a row.

Mordecai: Listen. I'm...I just really gotta go. Okay? (walks away)

Rigby: What?

Answering Machine: Tell us what the problem is.

Mordecai: Nah, I'm just...You know.....(floats off) Going this way...

Answering Machine: Where do you think you're going?!

Rigby: Dude, you're being really weird! (Mordecai starts swimming) Mordecai, what are you doing? Come back!

Answering Machine: You'd rather float towards the infinite abyss than talk about your problem?

Smoke Signal Fire: This is a safe place!

Answering Machine: What are you floating away from?

Mordecai: I...I don't wanna talk about it.

Answering Machine: Do you not wish to be with this CJ? Her texting history shows she's quite the witty and independent young woman. And she's quite fond of you. (Mordecai stops) There's nothing out there for you. Literally nothing! It's really boring! Trust me!

(Mordecai sighs and goes back to Rigby and the guardians.)

Mordecai: I really do like CJ.

Rigby: Pfft. Duh, you do.

Mordecai: I'm just afraid of what'll happen because...(sighs) part of me is still waiting for Margaret to come back.

Tin Cans with String: Daddy's girl?

Rigby: What? Still? She's not coming back, dude. She's gone.

Mordecai: Look, I know, alright? I know! It's just....I mean, I don't still have feelings for her, but I do in a way. It's like this thing that's inside of me, and it's always just sort of sitting there, waiting around, and sometimes I'll see something, or I'll smell something, and it makes me think of her even though I don't want to. I really like CJ, she's amazing. But, is it fair for me to go out with her if I still think about Margaret sometimes?

Rigby: Dude, CJ's way cooler than Margaret.

(Guardians talk in agreement.)

Tin Cans with String: This is a normal part of life.

Answering Machine: Where one phonecall ends, another begins. Even if you don't leave a message after the beep.

Mordecai: So, what should I do?

Tin Cans with String: That's for you to decide.

(Door pops up for Mordecai and Rigby to leave.)

Answering Machine: Uhhhh, also, if you have a music blog or something, we could really use some positive reviews.

Mordecai: Uhhh....

Rigby: Yeah, we'll look into it.

(They leave.)

Answering Machine: This is it, guys. This is gonna be our big break!

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby appearing back on the roof. Mordecai checks his phone, and see a message from CJ that says "What are all these weird texts? Is something going on?" He replies with, "Date tommorrow?")

Rigby: Are you sure about this?

Mordecai: (with a straight face) I'm tired of "pulling a Mordecai".

(He hits "SEND".)

Rigby: Nice.

(CJ replies with "Date date?" Mordecai replies "Yes." CJ replies with a winky face.)

Mordecai: Yeah!

Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai: Wait. What does a winky face me- (CJ texts again) "That means yes. Don't misinterpret it." Haha! Alright. (texts) "See you soon". (sends text)

Rigby: I'm proud of you, man.

(The two watch the sunset.)

Yuji: (hangliding from a roof) X-treme Yu-Jump! Whoo-hooooooo!

Rigby: Look, you know I couldn't be happier that you didn't back down from going on this date with CJ. I admire that. But tonight we had plans! Man plans! Man's!

Mordecai: (Turns to look at Rigby) I know, I know, but this is important. And I told you I was sorry.

Rigby: Yeah, well, sorry doesn't help me eat pizza and prank call Benson. 

Mordecai: But we do this every Saturday; I'm only missing it once.

Rigby: (Points at Mordecai) You know this is a two man job. 

Mordecai: (But Mordecai wasn't listening, and goes back to brushing his teeth) I'm not hanging out with you tonight, dude.

Rigby: Uuuuuuuuuuuuugh! (He dramatically throws his arms up and spins out of the bathroom.)

(A clock transition reveals that it is later in the day. CJ is standing outside waiting for Mordecai. Mordecai opens the front door.)

CJ: Hey!

Mordecai: Hi, hey! So, um, I'm glad you could make it out tonight. (He gives CJ a hug.)

CJ: (Chuckles) Woah! You're a real move maker today.

Mordecai: Oh, uh... I mean... I thought...

CJ: Hey, hey, I'm just teasing! It's cool. You already got me on a date, there's no need to impress me.

Mordecai: (Blushes) Ha, yeah, it's cool. I'm cool.

CJ: Pfft. Alright, cool guy. What are we doing on this hot date?

Mordecai: Well, we could go eat at the new falafel fusion truck, or there's the tried-and-true Wing Kingdom, and then after that I was thinking we could (Begins to count off on his fingers) go catch a movie, or go to trivia night at the arcade, or take a chance on disco night down at that weird bingo hall.

CJ: Yeah, sounds good.

Mordecai: Uh... which one?

CJ: All of 'em. Let's just start at the beginning and see how far we get.

Mordecai: Okay.

(They begin to walk away when all of a sudden, a ghostly green light appears, along with a portal that has spirits flying out of it. A van drives out of the portal, revealing Death and his wife, who appears to be yelling at him about something. Death then appears to be trying to reason with her. The camera focuses back on Mordecai and CJ.)

CJ: Uh... (Points) that van just came out of thin air.

Mordecai: We should go.

(He tries to quickly walk off with CJ)

CJ: (Still pointing) Do you know them?

Mordecai: Nope.

Death: Hold it right there!

(A door is heard opening, and Death walks over to Mordecai and CJ before they can get away.)

Mordecai: (Nervously waves) Ha ha. Hey, Death. How's it going?

CJ: (Looks at Mordecai) Uh... Death?

Mordecai: (Motions to Death) CJ, this is Death. (Motions to CJ) Death, CJ.

Death: Charmed.

Mordecai: Well, it's been great running into you. (He tries to leave again.)

Death: Oh, we're not through yet. (He gestures over to his van) You're gonna babysit Thomas tonight.

(He uses magic to open one of the van's doors. Thomas is seen sitting in his baby seat with a grumpy expression on his face.)

Mordecai: Aw, man!

CJ: (Puts up her hands in defense) Um, actually, we were just about to head out ourselves.

Death: Well, you're in for a change of plans, missy, because (He points at Mordecai) this joker owes me a favor. 

Mordecai: (He quickly glances over at CJ before coming up with a plan) Hold on a second.

(He walks a few feet away and dials somebody's number. Rigby is heard answering the phone.)

Rigby: Yeah?

Mordecai: Dude, I need you to do me a huge favor and babysit Thomas tonight.

(The camera shows Rigby sitting on somebody's couch, sporting a rather confused expression.)

Rigby: Isn't he like, in college?

(The camera goes back to Mordecai again.)

Mordecai: Not that Thomas, Death's Thomas! Can you help me out?

(The camera switches back to Rigby.)

Rigby: Sorry to hear that, but I've got some important plans that I can't cancel on!

(Just then, Eileen walks over to him.)

Eileen: Sorry we have to watch it on my computer. (She sits down on the couch beside Rigby) I haven't had a T.V. since I moved out of my parents' place.

(The camera then switches back to Mordecai, who appears to be shocked.)

Mordecai: Are you at Eileen's?!

(Rigby suddenly shouts back at him over the phone.)

Rigby: VERY IMPORTANT!!

(Mordecai cringes and lowers the phone. He groans in annoyance and then proceeds to walks back over to CJ and Death.)

Mordecai: Sorry, CJ. Looks like I can't get out of this.

CJ: We don't have to give up on our date just because of Thomas. 

Mordecai: Really?

CJ: Yeah! I'll just help you babysit him. I'm sure we can still have a good time.

Mordecai: Okay. Let's do it!

(Death walks back over with Thomas in his arms.)

Death: Glad to hear it. We'll pick him up at eight. (He suddenly remembers something) Oh, a little heads up. (Whispers to Mordecai) Thomas is going through a little bit of a phase right now.

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Death: Ciao! 

(He walks back over to his van and drives away, disappearing through another portal.)

Thomas: So. Mordecai.. we meet again.

CJ: Woah, he can talk?

Thomas: Obviously.

Mordecai: (He puts Thomas down on the ground) Yeah, he's actually three hundred years old.

CJ: Then why is he so shrimpy?

Thomas: (Gestures angrily at CJ) Who is this female?

Mordecai: (He points at Thomas) Her name's CJ, and you're messing with our date plans, so try to be nice, okay?

Thomas: Date?

Mordecai: Uh, yeah.

Thomas: And she's actually okay with being a girlfriend to someone like you?

Mordecai: (Blushes and rubs the back of his neck) Well, she's not really my girlfriend yet. 

(The camera pans over to CJ, who's blushing and smiling as well.)

Mordecai (continued): Uh, we're just on a date right now-

Thomas: (Interrupting) Gah! Such simple minds! You mortals have the most tedious rituals.

CJ: Hey, at least we're not three hundred and still wearing baby clothes.

Thomas: What?! How dare you.

(His eyes begin to flash a bright red color. This stops as soon as Mordecai addresses him, however.)

Mordecai: So, Thomas, what do you want to do?

Thomas: (Points at Mordecai) Take me to the playground!

CJ: Hey, not a bad idea. This could be pretty fun.

Thomas: (Angrily) Oh, we'll see about that.

(A clock transition shows little kids having fun on a playground. The camera pans over as a young boy goes down a slide and lands flat on his face in the sand below.)

Thomas: Where have you taken me?

CJ: It's a playground, dude.

Mordecai: Yeah, go run around or something.

Thomas: But where's the fire? The brimstone? The overall loss of hope?

(The camera shows a depressed man sitting on a park bench)

Mordecai: I don't know. That guy on the bench looks kind of sad.

Thomas: (Crosses his arms) Take me to the underworld playground.

(A stout, little kid walks over to Thomas. Thomas pushes him over, and the kid falls on his back, his arms and legs twitching.)

CJ: You haven't tried it out yet. Give it a chance!

Mordecai: Come on, I'll push you on the swings.

(They begin to walk towards the playground, the little boy's limbs still twitching in the background. Thomas complains loudly.)

Thomas: Daaaah! Gaaaaaaah!

(The camera shows Thomas getting pushed back and forth on a swing. He looks grumpier than before.)

Thomas: This is terrible! The swings in the underworld go much higher!

(Mordecai continues to push Thomas, despite this remark.)

Mordecai: Well, too bad.

(He turns when he hears music coming from an ice cream truck. The ice cream man is shown giving a little kid some ice cream.)

Mordecai (continued): (Whispers to CJ) Follow my lead.

CJ: (Giggles) Okay.

Mordecai: Alright. I'm gonna push you really high this time! (He pushes Thomas with all his might)

Thomas: Now that's a good swing! Keep this up and I'll... (He realizes Mordecai and CJ are gone) Wait. What the...?

(The camera switches over to Mordecai and CJ, who just received a cone of vanilla ice cream from the ice cream man. Mordecai holds the cone out to CJ.)

Mordecai: Wanna share?

CJ: Yeah, sure.

(They both go to hold onto the cone, causing their hands to touch. They smile at each other before being rudely interrupted by Thomas.)

Thomas: Fools! You can't leave me alone! You are here to do my bidding! Now take me to the underworld playground.

(Mordecai and CJ look at each other.)

Mordecai: We can't. Just play on this playground.

(All of a sudden, Thomas lets out a cry of frustration. His eyes begin to glow red again, causing the big ice cream cone decoy on top of the ice cream truck to explode. The ice cream man runs for cover. Mordecai yells in surprise as the ice cream cone he bought for him and CJ melts all over his hand.) 

Thomas: (Chanting) Underworld. Underworld!

Mordecai: (Who screams to be heard over Thomas) I'd take you but I don't even know how to get there!

(Thomas immediately stops throwing his tantrum and smiles.)

Thomas: I know how.

(A clock transition shows Mordecai, CJ, and Thomas being dropped off at Death's house via taxi. They are then shown in Death's garage as Thomas flicks on the light and presents something to Mordecai and CJ.)

Thomas (continued): This is how.

Mordecai: Dude, we can't all fit on that bike.

Thomas: Not that bike. (He points to another bike with a side car) That bike.

Mordecai: Great, but I still don't know how to ride a motorcycle.

CJ: (Turns to Mordecai) I have a motorcycle license.

Thomas: Then it's decided. The female you're trying to impress will drive us. How emasculating.

(CJ then proceeds to put on a biker jacket. Mordecai puts a helmet on Thomas's head, which makes him frown in protest. They are all then seen sitting on the motorcycle, Mordecai and Thomas in the side car and CJ on the motorcycle itself. She revs it up and begins to drive off.)

Mordecai: It's pretty cool you know how to ride a motorcycle.

CJ: Yeah, I did motocross when I was younger.

Thomas: Enough! Take a left up ahead and go into seventh gear.

CJ: Seventh gear?

Thomas: DO IT!

CJ: Okay, okay.

(She puts the motorcycle into seventh gear. The green headlights come on, which ironically are in place of a skull's eye sockets. A portal appears in front of them, and CJ screams in terror. They are immediately transported to the underworld playground.) 

Mordecai: (Nonchalantly) You get used to it.

Thomas: Ah. (He takes his helmet off) At last!

(The camera shows a playground that is surrounded by fire. It then pans around to show three evil looking spring toy animals and a sandbox with an eel-like monster it. The eel-like monster proceeds to eat a crow.)

CJ: (Shudders) Ughhh. This playground doesn't look very safe.

Mordecai: (Points) You wanna go sit down on those swings? I don't think they'll incinerate us.

CJ: (Shrugs) Sure. (They walk over to a set of swings, which are composed of wood and bones for handles. Mordecai appears to be slightly disgusted. CJ doesn't really seem to mind, however, and sits down before Mordecai does.)

CJ: Wow. Look at him go.

Mordecai: Yeah. He's really in his element.

(The camera shows Thomas feeding the eel monster another crow.)

(The camera then switches back over to Mordecai and CJ. CJ starts to swing back and forth, while Mordecai sighs and awkwardly climbs up onto his swing, making CJ giggle.)

Mordecai: Hey, thanks for coming along and helping me. I don't know a lot of people who'd do that.

CJ: Well, it's no disco night at the bingo hall, but I'm having a lot of fun hanging out with you.

Mordecai: Really?

(He sits down on his swing, and CJ bumps into him playfully.)

CJ: Yeah, really.

(They both start to laugh. CJ grabs onto one of his swing's handles, pulling him closer.)

CJ (continued): You know, I think this date is going pretty good.

(She smiles at Mordecai, and he smiles back. They lean in to kiss each other, when suddenly, Thomas appears out of nowhere. Mordecai screams in surprise.)

Thomas: Push me!

Mordecai: Uh, yeah. (He gets out of his swing) Here you go.

Thomas: Don't patronize me. These are baby swings. I wish to go on the elder boy swings.

(A much scarier set of swings is shown, complete with skulls, spiky poles holding them up, and a cauldron of fire at the top.) 

Mordecai: (Gulps) Sure.

(He begins to walk away with Thomas.)

CJ: I'll meet you guys there. I gotta hit the restroom. (The camera zooms in on her serious expression) I'll scream if I need you.

Mordecai: Got it.

(Mordecai and Thomas continue to walk over to the elder boy swings, where a praying mantis lady is now pushing her child. Thomas chuckles at something, and Mordecai suddenly grows suspicious.)

Mordecai (continued): What's so funny?

Thomas: Hmmph. You and that female babysitter are never going to connect. 

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

Thomas: Oh, it's been so easy to get between you all day. What a pitiful romance. I've barely been able to keep a straight face.

Mordecai: What the... you've been trying to get between us?!

Thomas: Trying? (Laughs) It's been as effortless as it's been entertaining.

Mordecai: Ugh. You little jerk. (He points at Thomas) That's it, we're going home.

Thomas: Oh, we'll see about that.

(He begins to shout so that the praying mantis lady can hear him, as well as anyone else who might be on the playground.)

Thomas (continued): What? No! I will not ask this woman for her phone number! 

Mordecai: Huh?

(The praying mantis lady looks over at them)

Thomas: She's obviously married! I can't believe you're asking me to pick up women for you while your date is in the bathroom!

(The camera shows a Cerberus mother sitting on a bench, reading a book while her child plays with a toy truck. She looks up in disgust.)

Cerberus Mom: Did you hear that? How awful!

(The camera then shows a serpent, whose child is sitting beside him.)

Serpent Dad: Ugh. Who would do such a thing?

(CJ walks back over to Mordecai and Thomas, unaware of what is happening)

CJ: Hey you guys, what's going on here?

Mordecai: (Laughs nervously) Not much. We should probably get out of here.

(Before they can do that, however, a shadow looms over Mordecai.)

Anonymous: Hey, buddy!

(Mordecai turns around. The camera pans up to show a Minotaur, who is wearing a rather angry expression.)

Minotaur: Are you trying to pick up my wife? Well?

Mordecai: (Waves his hands frantically) No, no! I'm just the babysitter!

Minotaur: What kind of sicko uses a child to try to pick up a married woman?

(The praying mantis lady responds to him in some weird form of insect gibberish)

Mordecai: Look, it's not really like that. I'd never go after your wife, honest!

Minotaur: Oh? So now my wife isn't good enough? You think she's revolting just because she's pregnant with hundruplets?! 

(The Cerberus mom begins to walk over, growling menacingly.)

CJ: We need to get out of here!

(The Minotaur begins to roar as well. Mordecai grabs Thomas and takes CJ's hand.)

Mordecai: Come on!

(They leap onto one of the elder boy swings, swinging over a seemingly bottomless abyss that lies below. They land roughly and begin sliding on the ground. They quickly get up and run away as the playground monsters pursue them.)

CJ: We've got to get to the bike!

(One of the spring toys narrowly misses hitting CJ. The Minotaur is then shown throwing another one, which lands right in front of them and causes them to be blown back. Mordecai looks up worriedly as they hit the ground.)

Mordecai: CJ!

(CJ grabs her leg, which appears to be hurt from the fall. Mordecai quickly runs over to her with Thomas as the third and final spring toy is thrown at them. He helps her up, and they run over to the motorcycle. )

CJ: Wait! (Mordecai looks up as he puts Thomas in the side car) I can't drive! My ankle is messed up.

Mordecai: Uh, okay. Then get in the side car!

(She hops into the side car with Thomas. Thomas puts on a helmet and she does the same. Mordecai puts one on as well and gets on the motorcycle.)

Mordecai (continued): Tell me how to start it!

(The serpent father roars and throws a sharp boulder at them. They cover their faces as debris scatters everywhere.)

CJ: Uh... turn the key!

(He turns the key, the camera zooming in on him as he does so. The motorcycle immediately starts up.)

CJ (continued): On three, let the clutch out slowly. THREE!

(Despite CJ's warning, Mordecai quickly pulls out and almost drives right into a boulder. The playground monsters quickly chase after them in hot pursuit. Mordecai swerves and catches a glimpse of the monsters behind him.)

Mordecai: We're not going fast enough! 

CJ: Get out of first gear! 

(Mordecai tries to do what she says, but he only ends up stalling the motorcycle instead.)

Mordecai: Huh?

(They get yanked back towards the monsters.)

CJ: You stalled it! Turn it back on!

Mordecai: I thought you said this was easy.

CJ: (Puts a hand to her head) Ugh, I was just trying to look cool!

(Mordecai revs the motorcycle and smiles as it starts back up. He continues to drive forward as the monsters follow close behind.)

Thomas: Can't this thing go any faster? 

Mordecai: This is all your fault! You make it go faster!

CJ: I know a way to go faster. 

Mordecai: Really?

CJ: Yeah, we just need to get rid of some dead weight. 

(The monsters are seen behind them again.)

Thomas: Well then, hurry up!

CJ: My pleasure!

(She holds Thomas over the edge of the side car, acting like she's going to drop him.)

Thomas: What? No! (He frantically kicks his feet) Stop this at once!

CJ: Oh, yeah? Why should I? This whole time you've been trying to get between me and Mordecai. 

Thomas: No! No I... t-that doesn't sound like me!

Mordecai: Yeah, right. You told me so yourself!

CJ: I've been looking forward to this date for a long time, and I'm sick of you messing it up!

(Mordecai looks over in awe and smiles.)

CJ (continued): Well, out you go!

Thomas: No! Pull me in! (Flails his arms and legs) PULL ME IN! (He screams.)

(The force of his screams causes a miniature abyss to open up in front of the monsters. A boulder falls in, causing molten lava to splash up and cover the serpent. The Cerberus and praying mantis lady are caught off guard and ram right into a boulder. The Minotaur is the only one remaining. Mordecai manages to hop over a chasm and get himself, Thomas, and CJ to safety. The Minotaur snorts and tries to make the jump as well, but only manages to fall to his death in the chasm.)

Minotaur: (As he's falling) No! I'm the victim here! You're the one who hit on my wife! I was just playing with my kids! (He finally hits the bottom of the chasm.)

(The camera switches back to Mordecai, CJ, and Thomas. Thomas opens his eyes when he realizes that they are no longer in danger.)

Thomas: Huh?

CJ: We totally tricked Thomas into thinking we were gonna drop him!

(Mordecai and CJ do a trademark 'OOOOH!' and high five.)

CJ (continued): Let's get out of here.

(Mordecai shifts into seventh gear, and another portal appears in front of them.)

Thomas: (Whining) Being tricked is one of my least favorite things!

(He begins to throw a tantrum inside the portal, causing the motorcycle to spin and turn upside down. They exit the portal and Mordecai swerves, crashing through Death's garage door. They all land on the ground. Thomas groans and picks himself up, taking off his helmet in the process. He then begins to laugh.)

Thomas (continued): When I tell my daddy what you've done, he'll torture your souls for all eternity! Good luck going on your dates then! 

(He laughs and bangs on the wall, causing a bowling ball to roll down towards him.)

CJ: Uh....

Mordecai: (He silences CJ) Shhh.... Shh... Shhh... 

(The bowling ball fall and hits Thomas right on the head, knocking him out. All of a sudden, a door is heard opening, and Death walks in.)

Death: What the... 

(The camera shows Thomas on the ground, snoring softly. Mordecai and CJ quickly stand up.)

Death (continued): So, looks like you're two for two, Mordo. If you don't watch yourself, I'll have to enlist you as a full-time sitter. (Laughs)

Mordecai: (Nervously) Ha ha...

Death: (Pokes a finger in Mordecai's chest) Now get out of my garage!

(He walks away with Thomas and slams a door that leads to his house.)

CJ: Wait, you don't get paid?

Mordecai: Nah, he just lets us live.

CJ: Well, really I should thank you for that. I can't believe you learned how to ride a bike so fast; that was awesome!

Mordecai: Yeah, well, I was just trying to look cool.

CJ: (Playfully shoves him) Alright, alright, I can get wanting to impress your date.

Mordecai: So did it work?

CJ: He doesn't need to impress me, I already think he's cool.

Mordecai: Well, he thinks the same about her. You've really been looking forward to this for a long time?

CJ: Yeah.

(They share their first intentional kiss.)

Mordecai: Want a lift while we try to hail a cab?

Rigby: Pulling weeds is the worst. Who planted these weeds next to the flowers, anyway?

Old Woman: Excuse me, young man. Are you responsible for this beautiful garden?

Rigby: Pfft, yeah.

Old Woman: You must know a lot about flowers. Are you an expert?

Rigby: I'm totally an expert!

Old Woman: (In manly voice) We got an expert!

(Cameramen come out from the bushes)

Rigby: What the---

(Cameramen point cameras at Rigby. The old women unzips her costume, revealing a young man in disguise. The man kicks away the costume and eagerly begins talking.)

Bert Coleman: Yeah, that's right! I'm Bert Coleman, host of TV's hit game show: Expert or Liar! Each week I disguise myself and question people on the street to see who's an: (Text comes up on the screen, along with people shouting the words 'Expert or Liar') 

(We cut back to the park house where everybody is sitting around, watching Rigby's debut on TV. Everyone appears to be excited, except for Rigby himself, that is.)

Muscle Man: Aw, I've been waiting for this!

(We then cut back to Rigby and Bert Coleman)

Bert Coleman: Now, Rigby, you're claiming to be an expert on flowers; well, we've got ten flower-related questions for you. Answer each one correctly and you're an expert! But get just one question wrong and the world will know you're a big fat liar! First question: what color are violets? (He holds the microphone in front of Rigby's face)

Rigby: Easy. Red! No wait!

Bert Coleman: That is... incorrect! (Bert Coleman points at Rigby) You are a liar!

(The word 'Liar' appears on screen in big red letters. We then cut back to the park house again, where everyone is laughing, to Rigby's dismay. Rigby hides his face in his hands as his television debut continues.)

(A person working for the show puts a cardboard sign over Rigby, which of course says 'Liar.' )

Anonymous Crew Member: You make me sick, liar!

(He punches Rigby, causing him to fall to the ground. Bert Coleman then bends down so he is at the same height level as the helpless raccoon.)

Bert Coleman: Flower expert? More like a big, dumb liar no one wants to hang out with.

(We cut back to the park house for a third time. Everyone is still laughing at Rigby's national screw up.) 

High Five Ghost: Classic Rigby.

Rigby: Aw, come on, stop it! What was I supposed to do, he just showed up and zipped off his face.

Muscle Man: You gotta admit, he got you good, liar.

Rigby: I'm not a liar! I may not be an expert on flowers, but I'm an expert at something.

Mordecai: Whatever.

High Five Ghost: Yeah, right.

(He and the rest of the park crew walk away, leaving Rigby to sit by himself on the couch)

Rigby: I'm gonna get back on that show, and then you'll see how much of an expert I am. You'll all see!

(A clock transition shows Rigby at the snack bar, stuffing nachos and cheese sauce into a green backpack. He starts to put in even more snacks as Mordecai enters.)

Mordecai: Dude, you don't have to do this, you know.

Rigby: I have to! That jerk Bert Coleman made a fool out of me.

Mordecai: How are you even gonna find him? He's always in disguise.

Rigby: Easy. His costumes are really lame. I just gotta find the weirdest looking person, pull their weirdo face off, then BAM! I go back on TV and prove I'm an expert.

Mordecai: Dude, that's the worst plan ever.

Rigby: I don't care! Nobody ever takes me seriously, and I'm sick of it! I'm going after Bert Coleman and I'm not coming back until I find him, so don't wait up!

(A clock transition shows Rigby walking through town, trying to find somebody that might possibly be Bert Coleman. He approaches an old man that appears to be having trouble with a map.)

Old Man: Excuse me, sonny, could you help me read this map?

Rigby: Maps? Yes, I'm a map expert.

Old Man: Oh, wonderful.

Rigby: I'm also an expert at finding you, Bert Coleman!

Old Man: Bert who?

(Rigby then tries to pull the man's face off, leading to a montage of several failed attempts to find Bert Coleman. He ends up attacking a mime, yelling at an ice cream man, frightening a couple making out on a bench, bothering a construction worker, looking into a horse's mouth, and even fighting with Bloodshed and Manslaughter, who fight back. Rigby is then seen walking around with a black eye and angrily eating food. He looks at a billboard that is advertising Expert or Liar, the camera zooming in to the word 'liar.')

Rigby: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr... (Screams dramatically) BERT COLEMAAAAAAAAN!!!

(Back at the park, Benson is seen walking into the snack bar. He is surprised at the amount of chips left in the nacho container and pulls out a tape measure to satisfy his suspicions.)

Benson: Oh no, no, no! These are not optimum chip levels! Mordecai, what did I tell you about hoarding snacks?

Mordecai: It wasn't me, it was Rigby!

Benson: Where is he?

Mordecai: He's not here. He got humiliated on national television for lying and now he's trying to get back on the show to redeem himself. You know, typical Rigby.

(Benson suddenly stops to think about what Mordecai said)

Mordecai (continued): Benson?

Benson: Did you say he was humiliated on a TV show?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Benson: I have to go. (He exits the snack bar)

(We skip to much later at night. Rigby is sleeping on a bench, mumbling about Bert Coleman in his sleep. Suddenly, a vehicle pulls up, its headlights shining over Rigby's body. A shadow is then seen looming over Rigby.)

(Right as he opens his eyes. Rigby is eventually shaken awake by none other than Benson.)

Rigby: Benson? Where am I?

Benson: My apartment. (He hands Rigby a bowl of soup) Here, eat this. You look terrible.

Rigby: (Takes a sip of the soup) Why are you being so nice to me?

Benson: Look, Rigby, I know we don't always see eye to eye, but we do have one thing in common. (He sighs and holds up a tape) I, too, was humiliated on national television.

(He puts the tape in his VCR. A much younger Benson with short brown hair and glasses is shown standing in front of a microphone, waiting for the show to come back onto the air. A game announcer walks up, ready to ask Benson the final question.)

Game Announcer: And now back to: (Text comes up on the screen, along with people yelling 'Say That Word!') Benson, you've made it to the final round. Say that word, and you'll win a hundred thousand dollars! 

Young Benson: (Runs around in circles) Woohoo! A hundred thousand! (He quickly pulls himself together again)

Game Announcer: What will you do with that money?

Young Benson: Quit my dumb job at the park!

Game Announcer: You work at a park? Sounds awful! Now, let's see that final word! (The word bandana appears in front of Benson) Alright, Benson: say that word!

Young Benson: BANANA! (His excited expression quickly fades when he hears a buzzer)

Game Announcer: Oh, I'm sorry Benson, the word is bandana. Not quite sure how you missed that one. (The camera zooms in on the word 'bandana') I mean, there it is: bandana! You just had to say that word. (Mutters) I thought we screen people to make sure they know how to read.

(To add insult to injury, a woman ties a plain white bandana around Benson's neck that says 'loser.' Right after this happens, all of Benson's hair fall out, leaving him to scream 'No!' as static overtakes the screen.)

Rigby: Whoa. Brutal.

Benson: (He puts a hand on his forehead) The mockery. The scorn. For years, I couldn't leave the house without someone handing me a banana. I would never wish that kind of pain on anyone. Not even you.

Rigby: Thanks, Benson. I just need to get back on that show and prove I'm an expert at something.

Benson: Expert, huh? Well, I think we both know what you're best at.

(Rigby and Benson both shout a different answer at the same time)

Benson: Slacking off!

Rigby: Sandwiches!

Benson: Wait, what?

Rigby: Yeah, man, sandwiches! Meat, bread, condiments, what else you need to know?

Benson: Alright, let's go with sandwiches.

Rigby: But how are we gonna find Bert Coleman?

Benson: Let me handle that.

(A clock transition shows Benson addressing everybody in front of the park house)

Benson: Alright, listen up! Today I have a special task for all of you. Go to all the sandwich shops in town-

Muscle Man: (Interrupts) Aw, yes! 

Benson: -and find Bert Coleman for Rigby.

(Everbody starts complaining)

Mordecai: Aw, what?

Muscle Man: Why should we help that liar? He's the one that got himself into this mess.

Benson: (Points at Muscle Man) That may be. But think of all the times his lying got you out of messes. (He points at Mordecai) Mordecai, who lied to get you out of your chores countless times? (He points at Pops) Or when Pops broke that vase. Who lied to Mr. Maellard and told him a bird did it? (He points at Muscle Man) And Muscle Man... (The camera shows a close up of Benson's face) How many times did you get Rigby to lie to Starla because you weren't man enough to do it yourself?

Muscle Man: (Crosses his arms) Point made, bro.

Thomas: Actually, my friend Cody's an intern on Expert or Liar. He might be able to tell us where Bert Coleman will be.

Muscle Man: Geez, Thomas, why didn't you say so sooner?

Benson: Alright, then. Rigby and I will talk to this intern. As for the rest of you: start searching those sandwich shops or you're all fired!

(The next scene starts with Benson opening a drawer of a file cabinet. Thomas, Rigby, and Cody are standing eagerly behind him, waiting to see what he'll find.)

Benson: Thanks again, Cody.

Cody: Anything for Thomas.

Benson: (Rifling through the files) Okay, let's see. (The camera zooms in to show the message on the front of the drawer which says: "Expert or Liar" Upcoming Episodes A-Z) Swim dancing, scuba diving, sword fighting... nope. No episodes about sandwiches. Wait a minute. (He pulls out a file) It says here that Bert Coleman will be at an arcade tomorrow. That's kind of your thing, right Rigby?

Rigby: Of course! Video games! If there's anything I'm a true expert at, it's that! Man, who would have thought skipping work to play video games would finally pay off?

Benson: Uh, yeah. We'll deal with that later. (Points at Rigby) For now, we gotta get you ready.

Cody: It won't be that easy. Expert or Liar doesn't allow repeat guests.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. I got an idea.

(We skip to the next day. A kid is playing Super Donkey Bros. when a short, stout man approaches him.)

Short Man: Hey, buddy, that's a pretty high score. Are you an expert at video games?

Kid: Yeah, I'm an expert.

Short Man: We got an expert! (The short man unzips his costume, once again revealing Bert Coleman. His camera crew runs over as he starts talking.) 

Burt Coleman: Surprise, I'm Bert Coleman, and you're on Expert or Liar!

Kid: Well, I've got a surprise for you, Bert Coleman.

(The kid unzips his costume, revealing a well-disguised Rigby.)

Rigby: We meet again! Now put me back on the show, Bert!

Bert Coleman: We don't do repeat guests. Get out of here, liar!

Rigby: No! I'm here to stand up for myself, and everyone else out there who's been humiliated on television!

Joe: That's right. My name's Joe, and they made a fool out of me on ‘Pull My Finger.’

Anonymous: They got me on ‘I Kissed Your Wife!’

Anonymous: ‘Pie in the Face!’

Benson: (Steps out from behind a game console) And I was humiliated on ‘Say That Word.’

Anonymous: Hey, it's Banana! (A banana hits Benson on the back of the head) 

Benson: Urrrrrrrrrrrragh. (Sighs) Put him back on the show, Bert.

Bert Coleman: You want a second chance, huh? Well, I have something real special for you. It's our season finale, and we're broadcasting live! (Bert picks up Rigby and shoves him up against a camera) Say hello to the folks at home.

(Back at the park house)

Skips: He's in for it now.

(Back at the arcade)

Bert Coleman: And that's not all. If you lose, we'll rerun this episode every day as long as this show's on the air. Which will be a long time 'cause our ratings are really good. So what do you say?

Rigby: Bring on the questions.

Bert Coleman: To the gaming center!

(A video-game like background appears behind Bert Coleman, featuring elements such as platforms and ladders. A pixelated audience appears, watching in anticipation.)

Bert Coleman: You must answer ten questions about video games. Each correct answer will move you ahead in the obstacle course. Let the game, begin!

(The platform underneath Bert Coleman raises up, taking the game announcer for a ride)

Bert Coleman: First question: How much lemonade takes you to the final level of Lemonade Stand?

(Four lemons and a pitcher of lemonade appear behind Bert Coleman. Bert sends a lemon tumbling down towards Rigby, which he dodges. Rigby then runs up a steel girder.)

Rigby: I know this! (He hoists himself up onto a ladder when another lemon comes towards him) Sixteen pitchers!

Bert Coleman: That is... correct! (The lemonade pitcher behind him disappears) Name the two main characters in Xtreme Xcape.

(The two main characters appear and try to hit Rigby with their guns. Rigby dodges their attacks, however.)

Rigby: Hairowitz! (The blond character disappears) Afroski! (The other character disappears)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Rigby scampers up a ladder and advances to the next level. Bert Coleman rides up on his platform, making three pixelated basketballs hover over his fingertips.)

Bert Coleman: The secret move in Hoop Jams 5000 is... (He throws the basketballs at Rigby)

Rigby: Triple Double Hand Combo! (The basketballs stop right in front of him and disappear)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Rigby crawls up another ladder to come face to face with two big, buff dudes. He doesn't even need to be asked a question, this time.)

Rigby: John and John from Strong Johns!

(The two characters immediately dissolve into pixelated nothingness)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

Rigby: The Hammer's weakness is furniture! (He bashes the eight bit character over the head with a chair)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

Rigby: Left, right, AB, AB, start! (He deflects a fireball right back into the Destroyer of Worlds's face, causing the eight bit demon to explode)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

Rigby: (Jumps onto a ladder) The Maximum Glove! (The glove flashes red and explodes)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Giant fruit comes flying towards Rigby)

Rigby: Shikara Yama Shi-to! (He eats a banana, giving him a boost of energy)

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(Rigby quickly jumps from girder to girder as Bert Coleman asks him another question, the camera panning up to Bert as he finishes asking it)

Bert Coleman: In Dig Champs, how fast are the giant slugs?

(A giant slug appears in front of Rigby)

Rigby: Trick question. They're giant snails! 

Bert Coleman: Correct!

(The giant slug turns into a giant snail and breaks through the girder. Rigby quickly climbs up two more ladders, only to end up hanging on for dear life as he reaches a final, spinning girder.)

Bert Coleman: Last question: Who holds the universe record in the game: Broken Bones?

(A giant Garrett Bobby Ferguson forms below Rigby and starts laughing)

(Back at the park house, everyone gasps in shock, and Benson looks on worriedly at Rigby from his place in the arcade)

Rigby: (He barely manages to hold onto the girder) It was... Garrett... Bobby... Ferguson!

Bert Coleman: Wrong! (Laughs) LIAR!

Rigby: I said he was. Until the record was broken by Mordecai and me! And I did it because I'm an EXPERT!

(Rigby jumps up and punches Bert off of his platform, leaving him to fall into the pixelated GBF's mouth. After swallowing him, the video pixelated Garrett Bobby Ferguson yells 'No!' and explodes. Rigby hops up onto Bert Coleman's platform.)

Rigby: IN YO FACE! (A giant eight bit version of himself appears behind him, along with the word 'Expert!')

(Benson happily eats a banana, and the video game audience cheers)

(Back at the park house, eveyone's cheering for Rigby)

Mordecai: He did it! He actually did it!

Pops: Oh, good show! Hahahaha!

Mordecai: Good thing he didn't go with sandwiches, am I right guys?

High Five Ghost: Sandwiches? Oh, no! Where's Muscle Man?

(We cut to Muscle Man yanking on some innocent bystander's burger costume) 

Muscle Man: Take off the bun, Bert! Take off the bun!

Pops: Oh, look. A squirrel.

(He sees a brown squirrel up on a branch. A butterfly flies over to give it an acorn, and the squirrel gnaws on it. It then bends over to the ground to drink some water provided by a fish in the creek. The squirrel then stretches out and starts taking a nap. Birds fly over it with a leaf in their beaks and they place it on the squirrel.)

Pops: I admire you, Mr. Squirrel. You're in perfect harmony with nature. I am also one with nature. In fact, I wrote a poem about being one with nature. Ahem. (Places a blade of grass over his eyes) A brow of grass, (Places moss on head) and hair of moss. Puddles are my dipping sauce. (Runs across the creek) A petal, a wing, an arm or two, presenting a hug from me to you! (Prepares to hug the bush, but gets prickled by a thorn) Oh! (Bees stings him) Oooh! (Wind picks up and a branch hits him. He runs away from the bush while holding his head. He falls into the creek, where snapping turtles start biting him.) Oh why, nature? WHYYYYYYYYY?!!

(Cut to the park house TV. A dude is shown surfing at the beach.)

Announcer: Surfers love riding the waves, but they also love having fun.

(Cut to a surfer on the shore at night)

Surfer #1: Ahahaha, brah. You see Duke in that last wave, brah?

Duke: Brah, I tried to pull out, brah.

Surfer #3: Dude, brah. You were just so deep in that barrel, I was like, "Brah!"

(The three surfers laugh. Mordecai and Rigby are watching this. Mordecai laughs while Rigby is eating chips.)

Mordecai: Is that really how they talk?

Rigby: Haha, yeah. "Brah. Hey, brah. Sup, brah. Brah-brah-brah-brah-brah."

Mordecai: Haha, yeah. What a bunch of losers. (Rigby gobbles up the chip crumbs) Dude, did you just eat the last of the chips, dude?

Rigby: Relax, dude. It was just crumbs.

Mordecai: Yeah, dude, but you ate the last of the chips before you ate the last of the crumbs, dude. When am I supposed to get my chip on? (Pops walks in, crying from earlier) Woah, Pops, what's wrong?

Pops: Oh, I'm just having a bad day with nature, I suppose. You mind if I sit here with you guys for a while?

Mordecai: Of course not.

Rigby: Yeah, take a loadoff.

(Pops sits down. Cut back to the surfing show.)

Surfer #4: Catching your first wave, it's just like, "Ahh"! I mean, I don't wanna sound like I'm bragging or whatever, but I really just feel sorry for dudes who can't ride waves. Cause you just pop up on that board, and you're just in it. (Starts riding a surfboard with seagulls around him) Just totally one with nature.

Pops: Oh, boy! (Starts clapping) That's what I have to do to be one with nature: surfing! (Cut to the City Beach. Pops holds up a book.) "Peachy Perry's 3 P's to Surfing Perfect". (Opens book) The 3 P's are: (Watches a surfer) paddling, pivoting, popping up! Seems easy enough. (Starts paddling on his board) Paddling. (Sand goes on dudes and dudettes) Pivoting! Popping..(Tries to gets up but fails. Three surfers come over to him.)

Hurl: Haha. Gramps can't even get up on his board.

Pops: Salutations, fellows. (finally gets back up) My name is Pops.

(The surfers laugh)

Hurl: What kind of stupid name is that?

Pops: What's your name?

Hurl: Hurl Hurlbutt. And these are my associates, Murl and Burl.

Murl: Hey, we should call this guy Mondo Cabezo.

Burl: Hey, Mondo Cabezo, can I rub your head for good luck?

(He and Pops laugh)

Hurl: Hey, Mondo! I think I can see your family on the water!

(Points to the round buoys. He and his friends laugh.)

Pops: I am as mother nature made me, sir.

Hurl: Mother nature gave you the worst body for surfing ever, brah!

Pops: (Holds up book) Peachy says anybody can catch a wave with enough practice.

Hurl: Uh, yeah. Peachy's dead. (Snickers)

(The three surfers laugh at Pops when they notice the other surfers going to catch a big wave)

Hurl: Primo surf. (The four grab their boards) Whoo! Yeah! (Noticing Pops) Ugh, get outta here, Mondo! You're gonna harsh our ride!

Pops: No! (Groans as the waves splash him) Paddle! Pivot! (Turns away from the wave) Pop up!

(Pops is dragged deeper into the wave and ends up knocking the three surfers off of their boards. Pops is washed ashore, and Hurl and his friends are standing over him, glaring. Pops nervously smiles and waves before screaming and running to Carmenita, flying off as all the surfers drive him away from the beach. Cut back to Pops's house, where Mordecai is with Rigby holding a tennis ball. Rigby chuckles.)

Mordecai: (Moving the ball) Dude, quiet. I'm trying to focus.

(Throws the ball onto the garage switch, causing the door to go down onto a perfectlly placed pencil)

Mordecai (continued): Hahaha. Garage beats pencil.

(They high five just as Pops arrives)

Rigby: Uh, how'd surfing work out for you, Pops?

Pops: Hideous! Not only did I not become one with nature, but I made surfer enemies.

Mordecai: Maybe it's better if you just forgot the whole surfing thing.

Rigby: Yeah. Try sticking to lollipops and fanciness. Your comfort zone. I mean, look at me! I've never left my comfort zone, and I'm doing great!

Mordecai: Plus, those jerk surfers basically proved they're not one with nature if they ran you off the beach.

Pops: (Shakes his head and puts on his hat) Oh, Mordecai. I don't mean to offend your reasoning, but surfers are most certainly one with nature. The fine people who live inside the television do not lie.

Mordecai: Uhh, no offense taken, but maybe you can at least take a break from the other surfers for a while, until you get the hang of it.

Rigby: Yeah, you're rich. Why don't you just build a beach here at the park?

Pops: Oooh, Rigby, that's brilliant! (Claps hands) And you and Mordecai can import dolphins for atmosphere!

Mordecai: Ok... (Scratches his chin)... or maybe just a wave machine for the lake?

(Cut to the Park lakefront, where the Wavy Train has been called.)

Wavy Train Guy: Wave on!

(He cranks the newly added wave machine up, causing the waves to build. Pops begins paddling.)

Pops: (laughing) Watch, this everyone!

(He turns the board around as he draws into the wave.)

Mordecai: You think this is gonna work?

(Pops starts to pop up, but is too late as he is tumbling over the wave. He splashes in. He swims back over to his board and waves to the guys. When he tries to hop back on, he struggles around.)

Rigby: Lookin' good, Pops! (to Mordecai) Yeah, this is never gonna work.

(Pops has faced away from the wave again. He goes over the wave and drowns underneath, where he get sucked into a pipe. This blocks the water from the machine.)

Mordecai: Uh-oh.

(We cut to Pops in his room with Dr. Henry and Benson with the guys.)

Dr. Henry: So you were saying Pops was surfing out on the park lake.?

Benson: Yes. He, uh, wanted to be one with nature or something, I don't know.

Dr. Henry: Well, we can't have that.

(He walks over to Pops' x-ray.)

Dr. Henry (continued): Just look at tis x-ray. Jumping to a standing position, with a head of this size, put too much strain on the feeble spine. Like trying to hold a bowling ball on a stick of angel hair pasta. Pops, I have to recommend that you stay on land.

Pops: But...but I'll never become one with nature on land!

Dr. Henry: Let me put this in terms you'll understand.

(He pulls out a lollipop from his pocket.)

Dr. Henry (continued): This is your body. And this is your body on surfing.

(He cracks the lollipop.)

Dr. Henry (continued): Any questions?

Pops: Well, I thank you for your medical opinion, Dr. Henry, but I intend to keep chasing said waves until I chase one down and then ride it!

(Clock trainsition)

Dr. Henry: But I'm trusting you boys to keep him off that board come morning.

Mordecai: Don't worry, we'll stay up all night and guard the door.

Rigby: Yeah, he'll never make it past our security team.

(Mordecai and Rigby place chairs on either side of the door and sit on them with their arms folded.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!

(A split second later, they fall asleep. We cut back to the park lake, where Pops has somehow escaped outside to try surfing again. When he pivots from the wave, he sees Hurl Hurlbutt coming through.)

Hurl: Alright! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Ahahaha! 

(The other two surfer friends are there with him.)

Hurl (continued): You were right about the sweet break at this place, brah.

(Pops stumbles over the wave like before. He rides back around the wave and the surfers.)

Hurl (continued): No chop no sharks...(spots Pops) Ahh! How'd Mondo Cabezo find out about our wave, brah?

(Pops gets back on his board.)

Pops: This is my wave.

(Cut back to the house. Mordecai wakes up from sleeping. He notices Rigby drooling and screams. Rigby wakes up.)

Rigby: What?

(They get up.)

Mordecai: We fell asleep?!

(Mordecai opens the door to Pops' room.)

Rigby: Dude, there's no way he got past us. Plus his head is too big to fit through the win-

(It's revealed that Pops sawed a big hole in the wall big the windows to escape. Mordecai and Rigby scream at this, scream at each other, and run out. Back on the lake, Hurl and the surfers are harassing Pops, surfing around him.)

Hurl: Get off our wave, Mondo!

(Pops falls off his board, his head in the bottom.) The other groundskeepers are at the scene with Mordecai and Rigby.)

Benson: What's going on?

Mordecai: Pops is in trouble!

Benson: To the lake boats!

(They run to get them while the surfers keep surfing at Pops.)

Benson (continued): Hey! Get away from him! 

(The groundskeepers are rowing the boats towards the surfers.)

Hurl: Brace, brahs!

(The surfers get knocked off their boards and bashed on their heads with oars. The groundskeepers cheer as they swim off to land.)

Murl: Hurl! We gotta call for reinforcements!

Hurl: Let us perform the ancient call of the surfers.

(The three surfers grab bongos from their van.)

Hurl (continued): (laughs gleefully) Wipeout.

(They play the call on their bongos, and Murl then points a signal in the sky. Random vehicles with dudes and dudettes in them, along with a band arrive at the park lake. They get out of their vehicles, hop on their boards and get in. Two surfers get into the lae windsurfing. Skips begins fighting them.)

Skips: There's too  many of 'em!

(The park workers start getting trampled by the surfers, and knocked into the water. Pops follows the surfers as they approach the wave.)

Groundskeepers: Pops, no!

Hurl: Time to crank this baby up to 11.

(Hurls cranks the wave machine up, causing the wave to rise up and push all the surfers, except Pops, offboard.)

Pops: Pivot, pop- ooh!

Benson: We gotta help Pops!

(The park workers swim off to stop the 3 surfers, while Pops is hanging onto his board for dear life, whimpering.)

Hurl: Mondo?! Get him off there.

(Murl and Burl surf off to Pops.)

Pops: Pop... up....

(The two surfers begin to try and knock Pops off his board, while Hurl is laughing.)

Mordecai: Hey!

Benson: Hand it over!

(Hurl immediately cranks the machine "Gnarly to the MAX" when Mordecai punches him in the face, causing him to drop the control and fall off, crushing it in the process. This in turn causes the wave machine to explode, knocking the park workers away. The wave gathers up all the water and rises up, and Murl and Burl fall off. The water shoots up into the sky, and comes back down, emerging as an ultimate wave, Pops being the only surfer on it. The wave rushes towards the park workers and the surfers. The dudes and dudettes run for their lives.)

Murl: The ultimate wave!

(He and Burl proceed to ride it, but Hurl stops them.)

Hurl: No brahs, it's suicide to ride that wave. Let Mondo have this one.

(Pops screams and desperately holds on.)

Mordecai: Pops! If you wipe out, you'll die!

(The park workers and the 3 surfers run off screaming as the wave draws in even closer.)

Pops: Pop up, Pops! Ride the wave, Pops! But, but I'm so afraid! Afraid of those rufians, afraid of my body failing, but mostly I'm...I'm afraid of you, nature! Why have you been so mean to me? Well, whether you like it or not, I'm gonna ride this wave!

(Pops finally pops up on his surfboard and laughs joyfully. The park workers cheer him on. He continues to dance and laugh.)

Pops: Finally! I'm one with nature!

(He begins to glow.)

Hurl: No way!

(As Pops continues to surf on the ultimate wave, he is joined by a flock of seagulls. A sun shines over the wave, a rainbow appearing. A shadowy figure is seen in the wave, revealing itself under Pops to be a humpback whale.)

Humpback Whale: (speaking through subtitles) Pops...You have passed the test. You are one with nature once more.

Pops: Let's never fight again! Ooh!

(The whale shoots water out of its spout, sending Pops really high, spinning while surfing. Four dolphins rise out of the wave. Hurl and his friends are standing on the van watching the nature scene.)

Hurl: Man, this was a bust. Let's go get some fish tacos.

(Before they can leave, however, the four dolphins crush them. The park workers are stunned at what they are seeing.)

Mordecai: Do you think he'll ever be back?

Benson: He's with nature now, Mordecai. He's with nature.

Benson: Guys, guys! I'd like to propose a toast. I know I'm the one being honored tomorrow with the gold watch for showing up to work 1,000 consecutive days in a row, but I want you to know: it's actually about you guys, (Claps) so thank you.

(Muscle Man, Fives, Thomas, Pops and Skips applaud.)

Skips: Thanks, Benson. That means a lot.

Thomas: How do you do it? How do you always get to work on time?

Benson: That is a great question, Thomas. Did everybody hear that? (Gestures to his forehead) The guy knows how to think. I've gotten this far in life by doing one thing, and that's playing it safe. I set three alarm clocks every night, including (Points to his watch) this one. And then, I leave my toast and coffee out the night before so that it's ready for me when I wake up.

Muscle Man: You eat stale toast?

Benson: Yes. And I don't like it, not one bit. But I know that it'll all be worth it the moment that Mr. Maellard honors me with that gold watch.

Hi Five Ghost: You must want that watch pretty bad, huh?

Benson: Oh, you have no idea how long I've wanted that thing! But tonight, I can finally stand before you guys and say: "I did it!"

(They all cheer)

Muscle Man: Hey, man, I don't mean to be a Debbie H. Downer here, but don't you think it's a little bit early to be celebrating? I mean, you still have to make it on time tomorrow.

Benson: Oh, come on, Muscle Man. What could possibly go wrong between now and then?

(Mordecai and Rigby show up with two guys)

Mordecai: Hey, Benson. You're not gonna believe this—these guys are celebrating 1,000 of something, too!

Tango: 1,000 test missions.

Benson: You guys are test pilots?

Stache: We sure are.

Tango: Hey, I'm Tango and this is Stache.

Benson: Wait, you're not Stache?

Tango: No, I'm Tango. (Gestures to the other man) He's Stache.

Stache: Why don't you join us for some wings, and we'll celebrate our 1000s together?

Benson: More wings? Benson likey, and I'm Benson!

Skips: I'm not sure more wings is a good idea, Benson. You don't wanna eat yourself into a food coma again.

Pops: Yes. Perhaps you've done enough winging for one night.

Benson: Look, I can handle it, guys. It's just one round.

Skips: It's just, uh... well, sometimes people do things they regret on a bellyful of wings.

Pops: That's all we're saying.

Benson: Don't worry, guys. I got it under control.

(Cut to black. An alarm sound is heard, then it fades to the next day in a desert as Benson wakes up and checks his watch. The time is shown to be six a.m.)

Benson: Ow... my head.

(He's seen stranded in the desert with a military jumpsuit strapped to an ejector's seat with a parachute behind it)

Benson (continued): What happened to me?

Benson: (Voice-over) What could possibly go wrong between now and then?

Mordecai: (Voice-over) Hey, Benson. You're not gonna believe this—these guys are celebrating 1,000 of something, too!

Benson (continued): URRRRGH, MORDECAI AND RIGBY!!!!

(A clock transition to Benson's feet as he runs through the desert, then cut to Benson running through the desert)

Benson (continued): Where am I?

(Checks his watch)

Benson (continued): Augh! I only have three hours to get back. How am I ever...

(He sees a road with a telephone booth on the other side of the desert)

Benson (continued): Wait, a road. I'm saved!

(He runs up to the phone booth, puts his quarter in, and dials a number)

Benson (continued): Come on, come on, pick up.

Pops: (On the phone) Hello?

Benson: Pops, it's Benson.

Pops: Oh, Benson; are you okay?

Benson: I'm fine, Pops. Listen, could you put Mordecai and Rigby on so I can scream at them for ruining my life?

Pops: They're not with you? Oh, dear, they didn't come home last night. We're all worried sick!

Benson: What the heck happened last night?

Pops: I'm afraid I don't know.

Benson: (Sighs) Well, whatever it was left me stranded out in the desert. Could you come pick me up?

Pops: Oh, of course. Where in the desert are you exactly?

Benson: Uh, hold on, let me see. (He looks around the desert) Great.

(He sees a police car coming)

Benson (continued): Oh, a car.

(A sheriff is seen driving the police car)

Benson (continued): Hey! Hey, stop!

(The sheriff stops driving and exits his car. The camera then proceeds to pan up to his face. The sheriff sniffs.)

Benson (continued): Can you tell me what road this is?

Sheriff: Sure. How about right after you tell me if this hurts or not?

(He punches Benson, proceeds to arrest him, and drives away)

Pops: (On the phone) Benson? Hello?

(Cut to the sheriff's office next to a prison cell, which has Mordecai, Rigby, Tango, and Stache in it.)

Benson: What on earth are you arresting me for?

Mordecai: Benson, you're alright!

Benson: You!

Sheriff: (Puts Benson behind the prison bars) Ha! Knock yourselves out.

(The sheriff closes the door as Benson grabs Mordecai by the neck)

Benson: What did you do to me?!

Mordecai: (Choking) Do you not.... remember anything?

Benson: No!

Mordecai: Get off of me and I'll tell you!

(Benson lets go of him as he takes a deep breath)

Mordecai (continued): Here's what happened.

(A flashback begins of the night before at Wing Kingdom)

Mordecai (continued): The wings just kept coming.

(The guys repeatedly shout "Benson!" as Benson pours a cup of wings into his mouth)

Guys: Whooooooo!!!!

(Fade)

Stache: Both of our engines were on fire, but somehow we managed to crash-land right in the middle of a hot-tub party.

Benson: I wish I was cool like you guys. Instead, I'm being honored tomorrow for 'playing it safe.'

Rigby: Ouch.

Stache: Yeah, that's rough.

Tango: If you want to be honored tomorrow with some Grade-A-Guts, you should drive up to the ceremony in the Mach Infinity.

Stache: Yeah, it's the supersonic car we just test-drove.

Benson: Seriously?

Mordecai: I didn't know that car actually existed!

Rigby: Nothing can drive that fast.

(Benson chuckles deeply)

Stache: You'd be taking a big risk, but in a cool way.

Rigby: I don't know, Benson.

Mordecai: You might be risking more than just that gold watch.

Benson: (Pounds on the table) It's worth it!

(Cut to the guys outside. Benson is patiently awaiting their instructions in the Mach Infinity.)

Stache: Just make sure your lift-to-drag ratio stays level. You don't wanna go into a high-G maneuvor.

Rigby: Whooooo! High-G maneuvor!

Benson: Alright, here goes. (Sets car to Drive)

(Benson starts speeding straight ahead and screams as he goes over the limit)

Benson: Stop! Stop! Stop!

(Fearing for his life, he yanks a cord and ejects out of the seat, landing out far in the desert. He passes out as the seat comes to a halt. A parachute pops out.)

(Flashback ends)

Benson: That's crazy.

Tango: Yeah. You landed about a mile away, but the car kept going and ended up on the road.

Mordecai: Yeah, when we went to go find you, the cop arrested us for speeding.

Stache: We even showed him our government clearance card which allows us to speed. But he just ripped it up.

Rigby: He was like, "nyah, nyah"....

(Makes tearing motions with his hands)

Benson: I'll go try and talk to this guy.

(Walks up)

Benson (continued): Uh, hi sir? I kind of have to be somewhere by nine and...

Sheriff: Well, we wouldn't want you to be late, now would we?

Benson: No we wouldn't, sir.

Sheriff: Well, son, the soonest I can open that door for you is, uh... 9:01 A.M.

(Benson bangs his head on the prison bars)

Mordecai: You didn't even look at anything! You just made that time up to be a jerk!

Sheriff: (Points) You open your mouth again, pretty boy, and you're getting the hose!

Pops: (Offscreen) That won't be necessary!

All: Pops!

Benson: How did you find us?

Pops: Oh, it was quite simple.

(A flashback begins to earlier where the sheriff arrests Benson, and a chicken vulture is on top of the police car.)

Pops (continued): While you we're being arrested, I happened to hear the distinct mating call of a chubby-necked chicken in the background.

(Cut to Pops using the computer to look for information about the chubby-necked chicken vulture)

Pops (continued): I tried to use your computing device to look up its habitat on the internet.

(It shows a shirtless man with orange hair and muscles, then Pops covered his eyes, and ran away)

Pops (continued): But, I got scared.

(Cut to Thomas looking for information about the chubby-necked chicken vulture, while Pops is standing up, looking scared)

Pops (continued): So, I called Thomas over, and he found it without any trouble at all.

(Flashback ends)

Benson: Wow, Pops, that's amazing.

Pops: Now, Officer, allow me to pay you whatever finds they re-crude, and we'll be on our merry way.

Sheriff: Are you trying to bribe me, sir?

Pops: Bribe?

(The sheriff throws Pops in behind the prison bars)

All: Pops!

Mordecai: You can't arrest him for no reason!

Rigby: Yeah, you think you're above the law?!

Sheriff: On this quarter mile stretcher highway, I am the law!

(The sheriff picks up a hose and sprays on them, and then closes the prison door)

Sheriff (continued): Y'all sit tight while I find the bigger hose.

(The sheriff leaves to get the bigger hose)

Benson: (Sighs) Well, you ruined my life again.

Rigby: What?! We have nothing to do with this!

Benson: I woke up in a military jumpsuit, strapped to an ejector's seat. Of course you have something to do with this!

Stache: Woah, Benson.

Tango: Nobody put those wings inside you but you.

Stache: Just because we party like handsome maniacs doesn't mean you didn't have a choice.

Benson: (sighs) You're right. I decided to take risks and this is the price I pay. We've tried everything but this cop won't listen to reason.

Tango: Maybe you can't reason your way out of this one.

Stache: Maybe the solution is...

Benson: ...another risk. Ok, I got an idea.

(The cop  comes in with the bigger hose, whistling. He sees only Pops, who is groaning on the ground, and drops the hose.)

Sheriff: What in tarnation happened here?!

(Pops slowly gets up.)

Pops: Oh, it was terrible!

(We see the others hiding and clinging onto Pops head.)

Pops (continued): They ganged up on me and beat me up before they escaped!

Sheriff: Escaped?! (unlocks the cell) Nobody escapes from my-

Pops: Now!

(Everyone appears.)

Sheriff: What?!

(Benson and the guys tackle the sheriff. They are seen running out through the door.)

Mordecai: I can't believe that worked!

Rigby: Yeah. I figured Pops' head would only hide two of three of us tops.

Mordecai: How much time until the ceremony?

(Benson checks his watch.)

Benson: Less than an hour.

Pops: (pointing) We can take Carmenita.

Benson: She's too slow!

(Tango clears his throat and shows Benson the keys to the Mach Infinity.)

Stache: It's your only chance, Benson.

Tango: How bad do you want that watch?

(Benson puts his hand out.)

Benson: More than anything.

(The others go into Carmenita.)

Tango: Perfect! Let's go!

(Tango throws the keys to Benson. Carmenita takes off.)

Rigby: See you at the ceremony!

(Benson looks over to the Mach Infinity. Cut back to the sheriff in the cell, getting up)

Sheriff: What?!

(He moves to the seat, slamming it, and reveals a compartment with guns, nunchucks, a grenade and other items. He takes the big gun and shoots the cell door open. Meanwhile Benson is trying to start the Infinity. He holds down on a button.)

Benson: Come on, come on.....yes!

(The sheriff runs up to him.)

Sheriff: Get out of the car!

(As Benson, drives away, the rudder slices off the sheriff's mustache in slow-motion, then the sheriff is knocked down to the ground. Benson escapes through the gate in the Infinity through the desert)

Sheriff: It took me thirty years to grow this thing!

(He gets up and starts running. On the road, he is in the police car, shooting his gun out. He tries to hit the Infinity.)

Benson: What the-?!

(He thrusts the Infinity forward. It speeds up, heading for 700 kph.)

Sheriff: Where're you goin', boy?!

(He pushes a button, and his car's engine powers up some more. While the Infinity is still speeding up, the police car's engine starts catching on fire. The front opens up.)

Sheriff (continued): Noooooooo!

(He and the car get obliterated. Benson continues to speed in the Infinity as the scene changes to rainy weather. A wing floats in front of Benson. The Infinity finally stops in the Park. The time on Benson's watch is 8:59.)

Benson: Yes! I made it.

(Benson walks up to the park groundskeepers, Tango, Stache and Mr. Maellard, who are wearing suit and holding umbrellas. Standing with them are some men.)

Benson (continued): Hey, how did you guys get here before me?

(The park members gasp.)

Pops: It's a miracle!

Benson: Well, I don't know about miracle, but...

Mordecai: Dude, where have you been for the last 3 months?

Benson: What?

Tango: What probably happened is that you went so fast, that you actually travelled three months into the future.

Rigby: We all thought you were dead, man!

Benson: Then if this isn't my gold watch ceremony, it's my...

(We are shown a gravestone that says 'Benson "You're Fired"'.)

Skips: Memorial service.

Benson: And who are all of these guys?

Skips: They're applicants for the park manger position. They're waiting until after the service to be interviewed.

(Benson goes up to his boss.)

Benson: Mr. Maellard, about the gold watch...

Mr. Maellard: Uh, I'm gonna have to say no. I've always been a stickler for the rules.

Rigby: Hey, man. At least you're not dead.

Benson: No!

(He runs back to the Infinity.)

Benson (continued): Without that watch, I am dead.

(He turns on the Infinity, and puts it in reverse before looking behind. Tango and Stache run after him.)

Tango and Stache: Benson, stop!

Stache: The Infinity's reverse gear could tear a hole in space time!

Benson: I have to take that chance!

(With that, the Infinity zips off.)

Stache: Now, there goes a man who takes risks.

(The Infinity is reversing down the road.)

Benson: Come on!

(A screw loosens out, and the glass begins to crack. As it zips out on the ocean, Benson's face appears distorted in slow motion. The Infinity begins to enter space time.)

Benson (continued): (whispering) I...I never knew.

(Benson screams as the Infinity reverses around the Earth. He looks at his watch as its reversing in time.)

Benson (continued): It's..... working!

(He accidentally dismantles the stick shift, and there is a bright spark. Parts of the Infinity begin to break off, and Benson pulls the parachute and screams as he exits space time and stops in front of the ceremony.)

Muscle Man: Told you he'd make it.

(The boss walks up to Benson with a small red box.)

Mr. Maellard: 9:00 A.M. on the dot! You did it, my boy.

(He reveals the gold watch, shining brightly.)

Benson: (sighs) It's beautiful.

Muscle Man: I brought us some wings to help us celebrate.

Benson: (chuckles) Sorry, Muscle Man, not this time.

Mr. Maellard: Come on, it's only one wing.

Benson: Well....

(Cut to black. We fade to Benson.)

Benson (continued): Oh, my head. Where...

(We zoom out to see him out in the middle of the ocean.)

Benson (continued): Ah, come on!

Mordecai: Alright, dude. Ready?

Rigby: I was born ready. Now stop talking and hit me!

Mordecai: With precision...

(He slingshots the pizza pouch and hits it above Rigby. We are then shown that the whole house is covered with pizza pouches.)

Rigby: Dude, that was like really close this time!

Mordecai: Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of the tension and... oh, hey Benson.

(Benson comes in, extremely mad. His voice is high-pitched.)

Benson: (Screaming) DID YOU PUT PIZZA ALL OVER THIS HOUSE?!! Don't deny it, I saw you. I saw you put pizza all over this house. (Circles around Rigby) And you, you're just as guilty. You think I didn't see you do the whole thing? Guess what? YOU WHAT?! You're cleaning it too, don't worry!

(Cut to a close-up of Benson, who is examining a pizza pouch)

Benson (continued): (yells, then hits the pizza pouch with his hand) YOU MAKE ME SO ANGRY, IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!

(Clock transition. Benson is still screaming.) 

Benson (continued): (yells) This is a pressure washer! Do you know how to use it? You better, otherwise, I'm gonna fire you!

(Clock transition) 

Benson (continued): You're cleaning every last inch of this house or you're FIRED!! DO I MAKE MYSELF CLEAR?!!

(Storms off)

Mordecai: (Sighs) Alright, let's get this over with.

(Starts the pressure washer)

Rigby: Come on; I want to use the wand.

Mordecai: No way, dude. It's a power washer. You need to have power to control it. You're too small for this thing.

Rigby: Come on, I got a low center of gravity. Nothing can knock me over. (Mordecai pushes him down) Oof!

(Mordecai chuckles. Clock transition of Mordecai walking up to the house, power wand in hand.)

Mordecai: Alright, dude. Give me some juice, but start slow! 

(Rigby mumbles as the sets the washer to a setting of two) 

Mordecai (continued): Ok, this is good.

Rigby: Are you sure you don't want it higher? There are all these other numbers on here!

Mordecai: Nope.

(Rigby sits on the ground and groans. He watches a butterfly fly past.)

Rigby: I can't take this! I'm turning it up!

(Mordecai turns around with the hose.)

Mordecai: No! Don't do it!

(Rigby gives him an a-ok sign, then turns the washer all the way up, causing water to build up pressure and scrape off some paint on the house. Rigby runs over to him.)

Rigby: I can help!

(He grabs the hose but only makes things worse. Cut to Benson inside the house, on the phone.)

Benson: So I can pick up my car tomorrow? That's great!

(Water sprays at the window and Benson watches the scene. He walks out angry. Cut to Rigby swinging in the air hanging onto the hose.)

Rigby: Mordecai, help!

(Pan down to Mordecai)

Mordecai: Dude, I'm trying!

(The pressure washer turns off and Rigby falls to the ground.)

Rigby: Dude, who turned it off?

(We pan over to Benson who is standing there, angry.)

Mordecai: Oh, no.

(Dramatic sounds are heard as we see parts of the house scrapped off. Benson walks over to the duo)

Mordecai: Sorry, Benson. We know.

Rigby: Yeah. We'll re-paint some of the messed up parts.

Benson: That's not good enough! You have to re-paint the whole thing or the paint won't match!

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Rigby: But the whole thing's like the size of the house!

Benson: Yeah. That's the idea. You have till the end of the weekend.

(Benson walks off.)

Mordecai and Rigby: UGH!

Rigby: Geez, typical Benson, right dude?

Mordecai: Whatever. Let's just get started.

Rigby: You know, I was right there with you until the whole "get started" part. We got all weekend! Let's go play some video games. You know, bro out.

Mordecai: No.

Rigby: Have some bro time.

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: Get in the bro zone? 

Mordecai: Just stop it, okay?

Rigby: Alright, what gives?

Mordecai: I got plans with CJ tomorrow, and now I'll have to ditch her because you never listen to me. I don't have time for this kinda junk anymore, okay?

Rigby: Come on, dude. I bet we can finish it all today. Then you can still see CJ tomorrow. I mean, we paint stuff all the time, right?

Mordecai: I don't know.

Rigby: We get some tunes, some suiters, and bro it out like a couple bros.

Mordecai: (chuckles) Alright, dude. Classic bro time. Let's do it.

(Rigby plays a tape, and a montage of the duo painting the house begins. At the end it's revealed the only repainted the garage door.)

Mordecai: Ugh! We're not gonna finish this today! You totally tricked me with your bro talk.

Rigby: Relax. You'll still be able to hang out with CJ.

Mordecai: How will I do that if I'm stuck here painting walls all day? This wouldn't have happened if you just listened to me in the first place!

Rigby: Okay. I can see how this is kinda my fault.

Mordecai: Kinda?

Rigby: Ok, ok. More than kinda. Look, you go hang out with CJ. I'll finish this up.

Mordecai: Yeah, right. The whole thing?

Rigby: It's ok. I got this.

Mordecai: Really?

Rigby: Yeah, no problem.

Mordecai: (sternly) Really?

Rigby: Yeah, you go. Bros helping bros.

Mordecai: (sighs) Well, thanks. (walks off) I'll see you when it's done.

(Rigby starts getting himself ready to paint.)

Rigby: Alright! Solo bro. Uno bro. Bro number one. Bro number two is with his lady. And that's cool with bro number one. Brody bro bro bro. One bro. (pauses, then goes inside) Time for a bro break.

(Cut to Rigby sitting down on the couch in front of the TV.)

RGB2: I hope you saved room for desert!

(On T.V., RGB2 is on a raft with Carter and Briggs. They are holding their respective weapons.)

Carter: Oh, we always save room...for donuts!

Carter & Briggs: Aw yeyeyeyeeyeah!

(The T.V shows an ad saying, "A WORD FROM OUR SPONSOR. STAY TUNED!")

Announcer: Return to "Carter & Briggs meet RGB2" after these messages.

(There is an ad showing Stealth Co. Rigby is awed.)

Rigby: Woah!

(The ad shows different stealth parts.)

Voice: (whispering) What is it that you need? (echo) Stealth. (echo)

(The ad shows a house.)

Voice (continued): Paint your house for free. (echo) Stealth. (echo)

(A message says: "We'll paint your house for FREE! 555-0100 Call now!

Announcer: This week only, be a part of our new experimental test phase and we'll paint your house for FREE! Call now!

Voice: Stealth. (echo)

(The house winks before fading.)

Announcer:  (swiftly) A subsidiary of the US government.

(Rigby begins dialing the number on his phone and calls. The doorbell rings.)

Rigby: Huh?

(He answers the door, only to find nobody there. He close the door.)

Rigby (continued): What the-?!

(A man is revealed to have come through the house window.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Afternoon, citizen.

Rigby: Who are you?

(He closes the window.)

Stealth Co. Agent: I'm a Stealth Co. agent from Stealth Co. Corporation.

Rigby: Wait, I was just calling a Stealth Co. about getting my house painted.

Stealth Co. Agent: I know. Just need you to sign the contract.

Rigby: Ok.

(The agent holds out the contract in front of him.)

Rigby (continued): Dude, this is like a million pages long!

Stealth Co. Agent: (flips page) Just sign here to get started.

(Rigby signs his name.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): (flips page again) And here.

(Rigby signs again.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Uh, initials here for us to paint the inside.

Rigby: And it's still free, right?

(He nods.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Mm-hmm.

Rigby: (places initials) Nice!

(The agent holds out a fingerprint scanner.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Fingerprint here.

(Rigby places his hand. The agent then scans his right eye.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Retinal scan. Aaaaaand blood sample.

(He injects a syringe into Rigby's right arm, causing him to scream.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Excellent, you are a true patriot. We'll be done in a few hours. Go ahead, go relax.

(He hands Rigby a fleece pullover.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): And please accept this complimentary fleece pullover, courtesy of Stealth Co.

Rigby: Wow!

(Rigby runs out of the house. Cut to the Coffee Shop.)

CJ: I don't know, it's just one of those things where it's like, "whoa". You know?

Mordecai: (chuckles) Yeah, I totally know.

(Rigby comes in wearing the pullover.)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Shouldn't you be painting the house?

Rigby: Oh, should I? (to Eileen) Your most relaxing drink, please.

Eileen: I'm on it.

Mordecai: Yes, you should. Quit messin' around and go finish the job!

Rigby: You can call off you dogs, Mordecai. I'm done. Because I listened to you.

CJ: See? You have nothing to worry about.

Mordecai: Yeah, alright. Cool. Thanks, Rigby.

(Rigby takes his drink from Eileen.)

Rigby: No problembro.

(Rigby takes a sip.)

Rigby (continued): Eileen, this is just hot water.

Eileen: It's good for your digestion.

(Mordecai and Rigby head back to Pops' house. Rigby throws his pullover in the trash)

Mordecai: So what do you wanna do for the rest of the weekend?

Rigby: I don't know. Maybe check out that loaded potato place.

Mordecai: (looks ahead) What?!

Rigby: It's a baked potato filled with stuff.

Mordecai: No, look. Rigby, where's the house?

(The house is no longer where it should be.)

Rigby: I don't know. It's supposed to be right- ooh!

(He bumps into something invisible.)

Rigby (continued): Ow! What happened?

(Mordecai and Rigby look up and see a bird fly into something invisible.)

Mordecai: Okay, this is weird. What did you do?

Rigby: I...You know, I just hired some professionals.

Mordecai: Rigby!

(He slides a finger at the invisible thing, and a scrape appears from before.)

Mordecai: Woah. What? What kind of guys did you hire?

Rigby: Professional guys! They seemed legit! I even signed this contract.

(He goes to a trash bin and takes the contract. He gives it to Mordecai, who looks over it.)

Mordecai: Rigby, this says "Stealth Co."! They made our house stealth!

Rigby: (gasps) What does stealth mean?

Mordecai: Aaah! I can't believe you didn't even read the contract.

Rigby: They gave me the gist of it!

(The Stealth Co. van arrives.)

Rigby (continued): Look, the Stealth Co. guy is right there. We'll just tell him to fix it.

(They walk up to the van.)

Mordecai: Hey, dude. This isn't...what we...want-

(Rigby opens the door, but the agent isn't there.)

Mordecai (continued): What the-

Rigby: Where is he?

Stealth Co. Agent: Over here.

(They look behind them, and see a still agent.)

Mordecai: Is that a piece of cardboard?

(The real agent tips down the standee.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Good eye, citizen.

(He takes out a handheld radar.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Mmm-hmm. Yes, these are satisfying results.

(He goes to the back of the van.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): As per our agreement, your house is no longer detectable by radar.

Mordecai: Yeah, or our eyes! Look, there was a misunderstanding. We don't want this!

Stealth Co. Agent: Well, that's perfect. The test phase is over, and on order to protect our formula, we will be destroying the product.

(He goes to the guys, carrying something in his arm.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): As per our agreement, you will be reimbursed $500, minus jet-refueling fees, which adds up to..64 cents.

(He place 64 cents in Rigby's hand.)

Rigby: Jet-refueling fees?

Mordecai: Wait. When are you removing the paint?

(The agent pulls out a walkie-talkie.)

Stealth Co. Agent: Let's wrap it up, boys!

Pilot: (on walkie talkie) Roger that.

Stealth Co. Agent: The jets will be here momentarily to destroy the house.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?!

Rigby: Well, well, how are you gonna blow up an invisible house, man?

(The agent pulls out a device.)

Stealth Co. Agent: With this tracking device.

(He throws it to the top of the invisible house.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Granny shot! I would retreat to a safe distance if I were you.

(He throws down a smoke bomb, disappearing in the smoke.)

Stealth Co. Agent (continued): Smoke bomb. (echo)

(Mordecai and Rigby cough as the smoke clears. The agent floors his van away.)

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta get that tracking device.

Rigby: Way ahead of ya!

(Rigby grabs pebbles from the ground and starts throwing them at the device, but they hit against the wall and window. Rigby grunts)

Mordecai: Rigby, stop! We just have to get inside and get up there.

Rigby: No, I got it!

(He puts up the ladder and tries to reach it.)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: I got it!

(He gets the pressure washer and tries to hose the device off.)

Mordecai: Dude, just do what I'm saying!

Rigby: No! I can do it myself! I can be a solo bro!

Mordecai: What are you talking about?

(Rigby sighs and stops.)

Rigby: We were supposed to do this together. Like we always do.

Mordecai: Then why did you say I could leave?

Rigby: 'Cause you got your whole "CJ" thing, and I wanted to help. It just kind of feels like we don't hang out like we used to.

Mordecai: Look, sometimes I'm gonna be doing other things. But you're my best friend. I'm not ditchin you, dude.

(Rigby smiles, then looks in front.)

Rigby: We're gonna die!

Mordecai: We gotta get inside the house!

(They get inside and start going up.)

Mordecai: Dude, it's the stairs!

(They run across until they hit a wall.)

Rigby: It's the end of the hall!

Mordecai: That means the attic's right above us!

(He reaches for the cord.)

Mordecai (continued): Where's the cord?

(He grabs it.)

Mordecai (continued): Got it!

(He pulls it and something crashes.)

Rigby: What was that?

Mordecai: I don't know, Rigby. Maybe it's the broken attic ladder you said you'd fix last week.

Rigby: Quit living in the past, man!

(The jets are heading toward the house.)

Pilot: Approaching target.

Mordecai: Come on. I'll boost you up.

Rigby: I don't know my way around the attic!

Mordecai: What, are you gonna boost me up there? Just listen to me and I'll guide you.

Rigby: Fine!

(Mordecai gets him into the attic.)

Rigby (continued): Now what?

(Mordecai points to the left.)

Mordecai: The window's that way! 

(Rigby starts running.)

Mordecai (continued): Watch out for the mirror! Left! Right! Turntable! Bird cage! Low-hanging beam! Mousetrap! Cobwebs! Close your mouth! Exposed wire! The window's in front of you!

(Rigby opens it and climbs out. Benson drives to the house eating popcorn.)

Benson: Ah. This buttered popcorn is good.

(He looks up.)

Benson (continued): Huh?

(As he stops the car, he notices Rigby running toward the tracking device.)

Benson (continued): Hey! Get down from there! It's not safe!

(Rigby finally reaches the device as the jets get closer.)

Pilot: Target in sight.

(The missile is being aimed at Rigby and the tracking device.)

Mordecai: Rigby, throw it!

Rigby: Where?!

Mordecai: As far as you can, dude!

(Rigby runs and throws the device out the invisible window.)

Mordecai and Rigby: We did it!

Muscle Man: Bros!

(They look down and see that Muscle Man has caught the device, and is wearing the pullover.)

Muscle Man (continued): How much do you think I can get for this thing? $50? $60? How about this sweet pullover I found in the trash?

(Mordecai and Rigby signal and scream for Muscle Man to get rid of the device. He takes a look at it.)

Muscle Man (continued): "Missile Tracking Device".

(He squeals and throws it back up.)

Rigby: No, not back to us!

(Rigby throws it toward Benson, who throws it to Muscle Man, who throws it to Hi Five Ghost. Everyone keeps throwing until Benson fumbles with it.)

Benson: No, no, no, no!

(He then accidentally throws it into his closed car window.)

Benson (continued): No, no, no, no!

(He is unable to reach the device through the smashed car window. He tries the door handle.)

Benson (continued): C'mon! Open!

(The butter from his hands get stuck on the handle.)

Benson (continued): Aaah! Why did I get extra butter? C'mon!!

(He tries pulling up the door lock, but his buttery fingers make it hard.)

Benson: Darn it!

(Benson drops his keys and fumbles around grabbing them as the pilot aims the missile.)

Pilot: Lock and load.

(He presses a button and a missile comes out from underneath the jet. It then speeds toward the car. Benson screams and runs as the missile blows up his car. After a brief explosion, Mordecai and Rigby cough and go toward Benson, who is overall tempered.)

Mordecai: Oh, man! Your car.

Benson: Car?! What car? I don't see any car! Maybe it's invisible, kind of like the checks I'll be paying you with FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS!!!!!

(Turns around and sees the house still invisible)

Benson (continued): AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOUSE?!!

Mordecai: Yeah, about that...

Benson: This is it, people. The big day.

(Everyone begins talking to each other. He sighs at this.)

Benson (continued): Pops?

Pops: Today is my dad's birthday.

(Everyone but Pops talks to each other again)

Benson: Seriously? Does no one read the emails I send out? 

(Everyone mumbles in response) 

Benson (continued): Anyway, everybody knows that Mr. Maellard loves surprises. But they also know that he's impossible to surprise.

Pops: It must be from his time in the war. He says he always slept with his eyes open.

Benson: (Chuckles) That's why I've come up with the perfect plan.

(Flips the chalkboard next to him. It reads 'Fake Surprise' in large white letters.)

Benson (continued): Bam! 'Fake Surprise'. See, it'll go down like this. (We are shown what he is planning) Maellard will show up like....

Mr. Maellard: (Shaking Benson's hand) Hiya, Benson. I'm here to pick up Pops for my birthday dinner.

Benson: And I'm gonna be all, 'What? I didn't know it was your birthday'. (Takes Maellard to the Snack Bar) That's when I'll take him to the Snack Bar where (Thomas pops up and gives Benson a cupcake to Maellard) bam! Fake surprise. (Benson drives Maellard to the house) He'll be so thrown off by it he won't suspect a thing when I take him to the real party.

(The groundskeepers are partying)

Mr. Maellard: Wow, Benson. That was the perfect surprise. (Hands Benson a bag of money) Here's a million dollars.

(Plan ends. Benson still continues to narrate what he thinks would happen next.)

Benson: Gee thanks, Mr. Maellard. You know, it was nothing really.

Skips: (Clears his throat) Ahem.

Benson: Uh, so yeah. That's how we're gonna do it.

Pops: (Clapping) Oh, that plan sounds wonderful, Benson.

Benson: Alright. Time for your assignments. Skips, set up the table. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, go buy balloons. Mordecai and Rigby, you're picking up the cake.

Rigby: Really?

Benson: Yeah. It's prepaid and everything. All you have to do is pick it up. (Gives Rigby the receipt) Just give them the receipt and bring the cake back. That's it.

Rigby: Aw, yeah!

Mordecai and Rigby: ♪Picking up the cake, picking up the cake! Picking up the cake, gonna do it great!♪

Benson: Just pick up the cake and try not to ruin my big day.

Mordecai: I thought it was Maellard's day.

Benson: JUST PICK UP THE CAKE!

(Cut to Top Tier Cakes. Mordecai and Rigby walk in. There's a long line of people.)

Rigby: Man, this place is packed! Why does everyone need a cake so bad?

Mordecai: (Looks at the receipt) Dude, check it out. This cake Benson ordered is crazy expensive.

Rigby: $130?!

Mordecai: Yeah. Benson's really going all out.

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai, check out that line. (He points at the sign) Nobody's in it.

Mordecai: It saids "Pre Paid", so yeah; let's do it.

Man: I got my cake, I got my cake!

(As a female customer is about to talk, Mordecai and Rigby switch over to the Pre Paid Order stand)

Mordecai: Excuse me, I'm here to pick up a cake.

Female Employee: Oh, if you have a pre paid order receipt, I can get that for you.

Mordecai: Yeah, we do!

(Female employee takes receipt)

Female Employee: Okay, it'll be just a minute.

Female Customer: Excuse me, I was here before they were.

Female Employee: Sorry ma'am, but pre paid customers take priority.

(She walks away to pick up the cake)

Female Customer: Hey, you two! (Mordecai and Rigby look up at her) That's right, I'm talking to you, bozos. You just cut the line.

Mordecai: Uuuhhhh....

Female Customer: Get back here and take a number like everybody else.

Mordecai: We didn't cut in line. This is the pre paid line.

Female Customer: Ho, ho. That's a fine excuse for a bunch of LINE CUTTERS!

Mordecai: Look, we didn't cut, okay? This is a separate line for people with pre paid receipts.

(All of the other customers murmur in agreement and start lining up at the pre paid order stand)

Female Customer: But...

(The female employee returns with a cake box)

Female Employee: Alright, here you go.

(She opens the box with a cake inside that says: "Happy b-day Mr. Maellard")

Mordecai and Rigby: Woaaaaahhhh....

Female Employee: Also, you guys get our last free cake pastries.

(Gives the pastries to Rigby)

Female Customer: This is ridiculous! I've been here longer than anybody!

Female Employee: I'm sorry, ma'am, but the sign says pre-paid customers get tended to first, so maybe you should learn how to read.

Rigby and Everyone: WOOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!

(The female customer gets angry)

Mordecai: (Nervously) Haha, okay, thanks for the cake. Bye!

(He and Rigby run out with the cake box. They then tie the cake on top of the cart and begin to drive away.)

Mordecai (continued): H-hey, I say this job was a piece of cake.

Rigby: (Munches on the pastry) Yeah, it was.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hahahahahaa.

Mordecai: Hand me one of them victory pastries.

Rigby: Uuuhhhh....

Mordecai: Aw, man, did you eat both of them?

Rigby: Sorry, the second one just fell in my mouth.

Mordecai: Augh! You're the worst.

(Suddenly, the female customer from Top Teir Cakes drives up in her car and bumps into the cart)

Rigby: What the?!

(She growls, and the car roof falls off)

Female Customer: LINE CUTTERS! (She picks up a cake knife) LINE CUTTERS ARE GONNA GET CUT!

Rigby: AAAAAHHHH! She's got a cake cutter! Let's get outta here!

Mordecai: Time to shake this cake witch!

(He pumps the gas pedal and passes the green car. She then bumps the green car off the road, and it explodes as they scream and turn to the left. She growls as she sees a Road Closed sign.)

Female Customer: Wait, what does it say? I wish I could read!

(She drives past the Road Closed sign and falls into a small hole in the road. Mordecai and Rigby drive into an alley and accidentally bump into a pothole. The cake box slips off the top of the cart and the cake splatters all over the alley road as they gasp.)

Alley Leader: Ooooooooooooh! Road cake!

(People come out from their hiding places in the alley. They approach the road cake and start mooching off it. Mordecai and Rigby scream as they run to them. The alley leader's phone rings.)

Alley Leader (continued): Time for the meeting with accounting! If we're late, Tokyo will drop the deal! Come on!

(They go to their car and drive off. Mordecai and Rigby look at the damaged cake.)

Mordecai: Oh, boy.

(Cut to the house, where Mr. Maellard rolls up to Benson in his limo.)

Benson: Hello, Mr. Maellard.

Mr. Maellard: Where's Pops? We're gonna be late to my birthday dinner.

Benson: Birthday? It's your birthday today?

Mr. Maellard: Yes. But I'm sure you don't have anything planned.

Benson: (laughs) Of course, how could I? I only just now found out about it. Just now. But you know what? I think Pops is at the Snack Bar. Let me take you there.

Mr Maellard: Mmm. Let's go see "Pops at the snack bar".

Benson: Right this way.

(Mr. Maellard goes to the cart. Benson whips out his walkie talkie.)

Benson (continued): I'm taking Papa Eagle out to the field. We'll be back at the nest shortly. Do you copy? 

Skips: (via walkie talkie) Who's the eagle again.

Benson: (sighs) Maellard is the eagle. It was in the e-mail!

(Benson grunts and heads off. We cut to the kitchen, where CJ and Eileen are with Mordecai and Rigby.)

CJ: Okay. So I get that you don't have enough money for a new cake, but you really don't know how to make one? Isn't it like, one of your food groups?

Rigby: Hey! Less judgy, more cakey!

Mordecai: There's not a lot of time. Can you help us or not?

Eileen: Does angel food cake cool upside down?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhh...

Eileen: Yes. The answer is yes.

(A montage begins of everyone pitching in to make a new cake. When the montage ends, the finished result is a four-layer cake.)

Rigby: You guys are awesome. This is even better than the cake Benson bought. He should be paying us!

Mordecai: Come on, let's get this outside.

(Eileen opens the door for Mordecai and CJ to get the cake outside, but because the cake is too wide, they are not sure how to get through the door.)

Rigby: Eileen, what did you do? It doesn't fit out the door!

Eileen: Hey, I can't do the math if I don't have the whole equation.

Rigby: Ughhh!

Benson: (via walkie talkie) I'm taking Papa Eagle out to the field. We'll be back at the nest shortly. Do you copy?

Skips: (via walkie talkie) Who's the eagle again?

(Cut to the party area.)

Benson: (via walkie talkie) Maellard's the eagle. It's in the e-mail!

Skips: He knows I don't do e-mail.

Hi Five Ghost: Where are Mordecai and Rigby?

Pops: Oh, they should have brought the cake by now.

Skips: (sighs) Let's got find 'em.

(Cut back to the kitchen. Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Fives come inside.)

Pops: Oh, there you are!

Muscle Man: What's the holdup, bros?

Rigby: It's not our fault! The cake won't go outside!

Skips: How'd it get inside?

Rigby: That's not important!

Mordecai: Look, we just need to get it outside before Benson shows up with Mr. Maellard. Does anyone have any ideas?

(No one says anything.)

Muscle Man: Way to go, dudes. You really messed up big.

Hi Five Ghost: Yeah. Benson's gonna be really bummed out.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan.)

Rigby: If only there was a way to--outside cake!

Pops: Oh, I might have something, then!

(In Pops' room, he gets something out of the closet.)

Pops (continued): Aha! Here it is!

Rigby: What is it?

(Pops is holding a box that says "KIMMEL - Handy Dandy Matter Mover".)

Pops: it's my Handy Home Matter Mover. I got it in the 1950s.

(Flashback to the 1953 World's Fair, where a salesman is promoting the product.)

Salesman: Gather 'round! Gather 'round!

(A younger Pops observes from the front.)

Salesman (continued): What you see before you will revolutionize how you move things! Let me introduce the Handy Home Matter Mover!

Pops: Oh, my!

Salesman: Does this sound familiar?

(A lady is carrying three kids while standing between a bouquet of flowers and an empty table.)

Salesman (continued): Say the missus wants to put a vase of flowers on the dining room table, but she has her hands full with the kids.

(The lady turns around in a clueless way.)

Pops: Hmm.

Salesman: Well all you have to do is key in the coordinates, aim and hit the switch.

(The machine teleports the vase and kids to the table, but as a result, they appear jumbled up. The crowd seems unimpressed.)

Pops: I'll take it.

(The flashback ends.)

Mordecai: A teleporter? It's perfect!

(Mordecai and Rigby hmph. Cut to the snack bar, where Benson is driving Mr. Maellard. Thomas ducks down.)

Mr. Maellard: Well, I don't see Pops out here.

Benson: Are you sure? Maybe you should check behind the counter.

(Thomas clears his throat and pops out with a cupcake.)

Thomas: Surprise!

(Mr. Maellard chuckles and takes the cupcake.)

Mr. Maellard: That was a good one.

Benson: Heh, right? And you thought I forgot your birthday.

Mr. Maellard: Well, it's certainly thoughtful of you to come up with this one surprise for me.

(Benson laughs.)

Benson: It's no trouble. One surprise is the least I can do. Let's head back to the house for Pops.

(They head back to the cart.)

Mr. Maellard: Yes, I'm sure Pops is very lonely waiting all by himself.

Thomas: Oh! Oh, wait for me!

(He tumbles out of the Snack Bar and runs off. Cut back to the guys in the kitchen where Mordecai is setting up the coordinates on the teleporter)

Hi Five Ghost: Are you sure this'll work?

Muscle Man: It looks really old.

Mordecai: Okay, I think I got it. (He presses a button to start the teleporter, but it activates for a second and powers down)

Rigby: Uuhh…

Benson: (via walkie talkie) Papa Eagle is coming to the roof. Get the eggs ready.

(Everyone mumbles in panic)

Mordecai: (trying to start the teleporter) Come on, come on!

Muscle Man: Hurry up, bro!

Benson: (via walkie talkie) I expect that everyone is ready to crack the eggs.

(Cut back to Benson, Mr. Maellard and Thomas in the cart)

Benson: Sorry for all the work calls, but we got a real eagle problem at the moment. But anyway, I'm sure Pops is somewhere around here.

Mr. Maellard: I'm sure he is.

(Benson keeps driving until they reach the party area.)

Benson: Surpri-- (When they see the party area empty, he gets mad) Can you wait here?

(Mr. Maellard gets out of the cart, and he drives off to look for the guys)

Thomas: Whoa!

(Cut back to the kitchen.)

Skips: (setting the coordinates on the machine) I think I almost got it.

(Benson and Thomas enter the kitchen)

Benson: Gaahh!!

Thomas: Oh, there you guys are.

Benson: Did I not make myself perfectly clear?! Papa Eagle is out there and NO CAKE AND NO GUESTS!! What PART of "surprise party" do you NOT UNDERSTAND?!

Mordecai: It'll be fine. We just had a few setbacks. There was this angry woman...

Rigby: And these shaggy-looking business guys...

Mordecai: But CJ and Eileen helped us to make this better cake. It's just a little too big to get out the door.

Rigby: But now we got this teleporter, so--

Benson: Are you kidding me?! I've had this whole surprise party planned out, AND NOW THERE'S NO SURPRISE!!!

Rigby: But the teleporter--

Benson: (snatches the teleporter) FORGET THE TELEPORTER!!!

Mordecai: No! We can still save the party!

(The three wrestle over the device teleporter which finally goes off and the teleports the cake and everyone else out of the room. Cut back to the party area. The wind blows off the tablecloth off the table as Mr. Maellard is still standing.)

Mr. Maellard: This is how they throw a birthday party? THERE'S NO ONE HERE! This is how they treat me... after all I've done for them? (sighs; quietly) It's lonely at the top. (Sheds a tear)

(The cake appears in the sky as The Flower Duet by Lakme plays and it starts to fall. Mr. Maellard turns and sees the cake fall and it lands on the table as frosting splats on his face and everyone pops out of the cake.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Surprise!

Mr. Maellard: Ah... ah...

Pops: Papa is so surprised he doesn't know what to say!

(Everyone cheers until Mr. Maellard passes out. Cut to black. We fade into Mr. Maellard in a hospital bed where he wakes up.)

Mr. Maellard: That was the best birthday surprise of my life! Where am I?

Pops: You're in the hospital.

Mordecai: You've been in a coma for three weeks.

Benson: Sir, I can't tell you how sorry I am. I just...

Mr. Maellard: What do you have to be sorry about? I've always wanted to be in a coma. I'm impressed you figured out what to get the man that has everything. This birthday really takes the cake.

Skips: So, who's up for cards at my house tonight?

Muscle Man: (holds up four tickets) Can't. Me and Fives are taking our ladies to see some Mexican wrestling.

Hi Five Ghost: Mucho romantico.

Benson: Audrey and I are going to a jazz concert.

Rigby: I got plans with Eileen.

Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost: Oooooooooooooooh!

Rigby: Friend plans. She wants to show me her new rock polisher.

Muscle Man: You know who else likes to polish people's rocks?

(Mordecai and Rigby glare at him, while Benson and Skips just stare in disbelief. All four can understand what Muscle Man said was an innuendo.)

Skips: Mordecai?

Mordecai: Aw, I would, but CJ and I are going to a laser light show tonight. But you can totally come with us.

Skips: Ah, no. That's okay. I've, uhhh, I got some other guys coming over. In fact, I better get going. Uh, have fun, everyone. (He walks off. Everyone says their goodbyes to him.)

All: All right. See ya. (etc.)

(Cut to Skips's House. Skips comes in, turns on the light and goes to his table, where he has food and a stack of cards set up. He sighs and puts the food away, straightens things up, and goes to lit some weights. He plays cards by himself, then goes to the fridge and takes sardines. Skips is seen watching TV and eating.)

Man (on TV): Baby, I don't know where I'd be today if I hadn't met you.

Woman (on TV):' 'Probably home alone watching a romantic comedy in the dark.

(Both laugh. Skips groans. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby walking along.)

Rigby: How was the laser show? (He elbows Mordecai.) Did you put your arm around CJ?

Mordecai: Did you put your arm around Eileen's rock polisher?

Rigby: Stop talking!

Mordecai: (stops Rigby) Wait. Skips?

(Skips is sitting on a stool outside.)

Rigby: You okay, man?

Skips: Yeah. (Then he corrects himself.) No! I've been skipping solo for too long now. I need to start dating again.

Rigby: Skips! Gettin' back in the saddle!

Skips: I guess. It's been so long, I don't even know where to start.

Rigby: Aw, it can't be that bad. How long's it been?

Skips: 200 years.

Mordecai and Rigby: Wooooaaaaaaahhh!

Mordecai: Well, better now than never. You just gotta get out there.

Rigby: What you need are some wingmen.

Skips: Wingmen?

Rigby: You know, your co-pilots. Your bros. The one's who got your back while you're looking for ladies.

Skips: Hmm. (cut to him picking up his phone and dialing a number) It's me. Uh, I need some wingmen.

Gary:  I've been waiting 200 years to hear you say that.

(Cut to a club called Shark Tank. People are hanging out. We see Skips, Gary, Techmo and Reginald at a table.)

Skips: So, uh, what happens now? Do we just sit here and wait till they come talk to us?

Gary: Waiting doesn't get you the ladies, Skips.

Techmo: Watch and learn.

(We see two ladies seated at a table. Gary and Techmo walk over to them.)

Gary: Excuse me, ladies. Perhaps you could settle a bet. Which one of us do you think is older?

Lady #1: I dunno.

Gary: Neither. We're both immortal. (He snaps his fingers. The ladies disappear and reappear next to Gary and Techmo, respectively.) Plus, we're magic.

(The ladies laugh as they walk off with Gary and Techmo.)

Reginald: Ooh, check it out.

(Two ladies are widely smiling at Reginald and Skips.) Fly honies giving us eye contact. (They go to the ladies.)

Reginald (continued): Excuse me. Are you a parking ticket? Cause you've got "fine" written all over you.

(They laugh.)

Lady #2: We are fine.

Reginald: Hey, that's a nice outfit you have on there. (bumps Skips)

Skips: Uh, yeah. (stammers) I like it a lot.

Lady #3: What do you like about it?

Skips: Oh, uh, it looks comfortable, uh, like uhh....(sees Reginald's "diaper") Like my friend's diaper!

Lady #3: My dress looks like a diaper?! (Reginald glares at Skips) He just said I'm wearing a diaper! (smashes plate)

(Cut back to Skips's house, where Mordecai and Rigby are laughing and throwing cards into a trashcan. Gary's car magically appears to drop Skips off.)

Gary: We'll try again next week, Skips. (to the ladies) Who wants to see a supernova?

(The ladies laugh again. Reginald sticks his heard through the window.)

Reginald: And, by the way, it's not a diaper! (Gary drives off) They're adult diapers! There's a differeeeeeeeence!

(Skips sighs and goes to Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: Hey, Skips.

Rigby: Meet any fine females tonight?

Skips: I'm just not cut out for the whole club scene.

Rigby: Dude, nobody meets anybody at clubs anymore.

Mordecai: Yeah. There's an option for people like you who make terrible first impressions.

Both: The internet!

(Cut to computer room. Mordecai and Rigby are setting up an online dating profile for Skips.)

Mordecai: Alright. We gotta fill in your profile. Profession?

Skips: Park Groundskeeper.

Mordecai: Uh-uh-uh. (airquotes) Enviromental Technologist.

Rigby: (typing) Hobbies?

Skips: I'm good at fixing stuff.

Rigby: Mechanical wiz who can fix anything: busted engines, broken hearts, whatever you got.

Mordecai: You've travelled all over the world. Girls like a guy who's cultured.

Rigby: Fought monsters with a ninja sword, arm wrestled Death, and also you love kittens to show your softer side. And done! (clicks and completes the profile "Skipster")

Skips: Now, what do we do?

Mordecai: Sit back and let the ladies come to you.

Skips: How long's it gonna take?

Mordecai: I dunno. It could be a while.

(Computer beeps)

Rigby: Whoa, look at that! You've already got 85,000 views!

Mordecai: Dude, you're on the front page of the website! "Based on your top-rated profile, you've been selected to be a contestant on the hit dating show It's a Date!"

Skips: What?

Mordecai: Aw, man. You'll meet someone now for sure!

Rigby: Up high! (raises his hand)

Skips: I can't go on a dating show. I'm not that kind of guy.

Rigby: Would you rather be the kind of guy who spends the next 200 years shuffling his cards?

(Skips is at loss for words. We are then shown Two Peaks Mall. Mordecai, Rigby and Skips enter a shop called Player Station, where Skips tries on a suit and new shoes. The guys are impressed. They go to another place in the mall called Spray Crazy, where Skips gets a spray tan. We are shown Cheap Cuts, where Skips gets a haircut. When it's finished, Mordecai and Rigby are happy with his new look. Cut back to Skips's house, where he is looking himself in the mirror.)

Mordecai: Looking good, Skips!

Skips: I don't know. These pants are a little tight.

Rigby: You wanna look cool, right!

Skips: (sighs) Yes.

Mordecai: It's getting late. We gotta get you prepped for the questions on the show tonight.

Skips: What questions?

Rigby: Dude, the ladies ask you questions and you impress them with your slick responses.

Mordecai: (takes out cards) Here, let's run through a practice round. "If you were trapped on a desert island with just one thing, what would it be?"

Rigby: Boom! Go!

Skips: That's easy. Fresh water.

Rigby: (sounds like a buzzer) Wrong! You gotta say something cool like, "All I need is your deep blue eyes to look into," Cheese it up! Make em laugh! It's not hard.

Skips: How do you know?

Rigby: Cause I've seen every episode of It's a Date! (silence) What? I've had a lotta spare time since Mordecai started dating CJ.

Skips: If you're so good at this, why don't you do it?!

Rigby: I would if I could!

Skips: Oh, so you adimt that you can't?!

Rigby: No! It's just that I don't have the right look or whatever, which has nothing to do with me being cool with my words.

Skips: Well, I'm not a word guy, okay?!

Mordecai: Hmm-hmm-hmm. I got an idea.

(Scene cuts to 'It's a Date!')

Announcer: Welcome to It's a Date! Let's give it up for your host, Bob Karpett! 

(Bob walks on stage as the live audience cheers.)

Bob: Thank you, thank you! Let's give a warm welcome to our bachelorette, Sheena Albright! (Sheena walks on stage) Sheena is a molecular biologist who loves tennis, Italian cuisine, and sloths. (Audience cheers) Now it's time to meet our 3 eligible bachelors! (We are show 3 shadows) Bachelor number one is a hip-hop enthusiast. (Shadow reveals a guy with a body of a horse) Please welcome Jimmy Jamzz! 

Jimmy: Yo yo yo! What's peepin', Sheena?

Sheena: (giggles) Yo!

Bob: Bachelor number two runs his own T-shirt business. (Shadow reveals a guy wearing and holding a t-shirt) Say hello to the T-Shirt Man!

T-Shirt Man: Buy my t-shirts!

Bob: And, bachelor number three is a ventriloquist. (Shadow reveals Skips with Rigby as a ventriloquist) Say hello to Skips and his dummy, Lil' Rigs!

Rigby: Hey hey, what's shaking, dogface? Hold on tight, strap yourself in, cause a date with me will make your head spin!

(Sheena laughs with the audience as Skips smiles.)

Bob: Alright, Sheena. It's time for your first question for our bachelors.

Sheena: If we went out on a date, where would you take me? Bachelor #1.

Jimmy: Girl, I'd take you to the hoppinest dance club in town. 'Cause Jimmy Jamzz is all about bustin' killer moves, girl! (belly rolls) Aw yeah. dawg!

Sheena: Okay. Bachelor #2.

T-Shirt Man: I would take you to a fine dining establishment and then show you my latest line a t-shirts! (takes off shirt revealing one with a heart and whoops)

Sheena: Hmmm. Bachelor #3?

Skips: Uh, go out for a nice meal?

Rigby: And go to the planetarium! Cause you surely belong with all the other heavenly bodies.

(Audience oooohs while Sheena blushes and giggles.)

Sheena: Next question. What is your biggest dream in life? Bachelor #1.

Jimmy: Pssh. Girl, I'm already living my dream! I've been regional hip-hop dance champion 9 time in a row, player! Shout out to my Four Legger Crew! (crew dances)

Sheena: Bachelor #2?

T-Shirt Man: My dream is to sell my t-shirts in all stores nationwide. That and move out of my momma's basement.

Sheena: Ehh. Bachelor #3.

Skips: Well, uh, save up for retirement.

Rigby: Geez, Gramps! You're not dead yet! But judging by you stage presence, you might as well be! Hey yo! (Audience laughs while Skips is not amused) But seriously, Sheena. My only dream is to make each day with you better than the last.

Audience: Awww!

Sheena: Uh, why thank you, Bachelor #3.

T-Shirt Man: Aw, come on! That's the worst pickup line I ever heard!

Rigby: The only thing you should pick up is a pair of scissors and cut off that lame mullet! 

(Audience laugh while T-Shirt man feels his hair.)

Skips: Rigby!

Rigby: Hey, the audience loves me. Wish I could say the same for these two dummies.

T-Shirt Man: You callin' me a dummy, dummy?

Rigby: No, but you know who is calling you is your mom! She wants you ringcheck, fool!

T-Shirt Man: I've had enough of your lip, son! Playtime's over! (He rips off his heart shirt revealing a fist shirt, then takes a gun setting it from "Stadium Event" to "Kill Some Fool". He starts shooting T-shirt bullets at Skips but he carries Rigby out of harm's way.)

Jimmy: (starts hip-hop dancing) I just cen-tore it up! (starts crashing the set, causing Sheena to scream)

T-Shirt Man: Eat t-shirt! (shoots more t-shirts around the set)

Four Legged Crew Member #1: Let's teach this punk some manners! (gets shot by a t-shirt)

(The T-Shirt Man shoot a stagelight. The audience and Bob scream as it's about to fall on him. Skips grabs the stagelight and throws it aside. He moves Jimmy out of the way of a stage wall. He see T-Shirt Man.)

Skips: That's enough! (grabs gun and punches him.)

Mordecai: Look out!

(Skips notices the stage pillars falling on each other, and one is about to fall on a screaming Sheena, when he holds it up, causing his suit it rip off, stunning her. He throws the pillar aside.)

Skips: You okay? (He lifts Sheena and grabs a mic.) Look everyone I'm not a ventriloquist. (Audience gasps. He points to Rigby.) And this isn't a dummy, (Audience gasps again.) The truth is, I'm just a simple guy who works at a park, a quiet guy who want meet a nice girl. Someone I can spend time with and talk to, and, uh,  doesn't mind that I like to go commando. (Man signals gasp sign. Audience gasps) Anyway, I'm sorry I wasted everybody's time. (drops mic and leaves)

Sheena: Wait! I choose Bachelor #3!

Skips: Huh?

Bob: (picks up mic) It's a date! (Sheena runs up to Skips as the audience cheers. T-Shirt Man reveals a sad face shirt) Sheena and Skips, you two win an all-expenses-paid trip to Costa Rica!

(The audience, including Mordecai and Rigby, continues to cheer as Sheena and Skips smile at each other. We cut to Pop's house sometime later, where Mordecai and Rigby are waiting. A taxi drives up, and Skips comes out.)

Skips: Keep the change! (taxi drives off)

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips! Skips! Skips!

Rigby: How was Costa Rica with your chicka?!

Skips: Well, uhhh. (we are shown various scenes from Skips' trips) Ah, she was too high-maintenance. But I'm back in the saddle. Thanks, guys.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoooooooaaaaaaaaaaaa!

Mordecai: Nice, nice. 

Muscle Man: Hey, Thomas!

Thomas: Hey, Muscle Man. What's up?

Muscle Man: (throws laundry on Thomas) Make yourself useful by taking my clothes to the drycleaners. And no starch this time. It wreaks havoc on my pepperonis.

Thomas: Oh. Sorry.

Muscle Man: Don't be sorry, be aware!

Thomas: Okay. Thanks, Muscle Man. (Walks into the hall) Aw, man... (Picks up a piece of underwear when he hears Skips in the other room)

Skips: So you wanted to talk to me about Thomas? (Thomas begins listening through the door)

Benson: Yeah. Well, don't get me wrong, Thomas is a good kid. But, man, I've been spending so much time on this internship program!

Skips: Oh, yeah.

Benson: I think we're gonna have to let Thomas go.

Skips: That's a shame. But I can see where you're coming from.

Benson: Yeah. The last thing this park needs is another worker standing around doing nothing all day. That's already Mordecai and Rigby's job, am I right?

Skips: Yeah, I heard that. (Sips coffee)

Benson: Well, I better go find Thomas to give him the bad news.

Thomas: (To his mom) Mom, Benson says he's gonna fire me if I can't make myself useful! What should I - (Benson walks out of the room) - Okay, I'll try. (Turns to Benson) Hey, Benson! How's it going?

Benson: Not great, actually.

Thomas: Well, glad to hear it! As for me, I was just going over all the duties I fulfilled at the Park today.

Benson: Which duties, exactly?

Thomas: Well, for instance, Oh, uh, I put sawdust on the barf around the perimeter of the merry-go-round? And, umm... Stuff like that! You know, duties! You agree that stuff's important, right? You don't want barf in your park, do you?

Benson: Of course not. I'm extremely anti-barf. Still, Thomas, I have some-

(Walkie-talkie transmission)

Mordecai: Bad news! Benson, come in!

Benson: This better be important. I'm in the middle of something.

Mordecai: It's the statue! It's gone!

Benson: What??

(Shows statue is missing)

Benson: (Slams clipboard on ground) Ugh! I can't believe Gene did it again!

Thomas: Wait, who's Gene?

Skips: Gene's the prank obsessed manager from our rival park. Every year, he and his goons steal the statue of Curtis Montgomery, and we have to go recover it.

Thomas: Wait, who's Curtis Montgomery?

Benson: He's the park's founder.

(He shows Thomas a postcard picture of Curtis Montgomery punching a bear in 1851)

Thomas: Huh. So, how can I help?

Benson: Thomas, you're just an intern. You're not necessary in this one. Besides, we already have a backup plan. Suit up, you guys, we're going with Operation Alien Strike Force.

Rigby: Yes! I knew we'd do one of mine eventually.

Thomas: Can I come at least?

Mordecai: Well, we only have enough costumes for the six of us. 

Rigby: Plus, there's no time to brief you and this plan is air tight! You'll just be dead weight.

(Everyone except for Thomas and Benson run off)

Benson: Just go take a seat in my office and wait for me there, okay? I still need to talk to you when we get back.

Thomas: I am necessary. I just need to prove it.

(Scene goes to night time at the park house. Thomas goes onto the roof and takes out a walkie talkie and binoculars.)

Benson Over Walkie Talkie: Alright Muscle Man, go. 

(Scene goes to East Pines Park, Muscle Man runs to the gate.)

Muscle Man: Help, help! I'm stuck! 

(Gene and others run to Muscle Man)

Gene: What's going on here? 

(Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops, Skips, and High-Five Ghost run over in alien costumes)

Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops, Skips, and High-Five Ghost in Unison: We are aliens! Surrender to us now!

East Pines Worker: What? Aliens? 

Gene: You blockheads, it's just Benson and his men in cheap costumes! They're trespassing! Fire at will!

(East Pine Workers click tomato shooters and start shooting, Thomas then fires a flare without anyone knowing it was him)

East Pines Worker: It's an UFO! 

Other East Pines Worker: Oh no, more aliens!

(East Pines Workers run into their park, Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man, and High-Five Ghost run back into their golf cart and go back, scene cuts to the house, then everyone gathered into Benson's office.)

Benson: We need a better plan to get the statue back. 

Rigby: How about we go in there dressed as zombies?

Benson: No, no more costumes. 

Muscle Man: I say we just demo the supply bunkers. 

Benson: Sounds like a lot of people could get hurt.

Muscle Man: Yeah, that's the point! They shot us with tomatoes!

Thomas: Guys, I have an idea! I could go undercover as an intern and gather information. We'll take them down from the inside!

Benson: Uh, Thomas... no. I didn't want to do this in front of everyone, but, you're fi-

Thomas: (cuts Benson off ) Wait! I know I'm not the most important worker around here and during my internship here, I've gotten to know each of you, and I finally feel like you've accepted me. I don't want to lose that. Please, just give me this one chance to show that I can be a valuable member to this park. Plus, (takes out flare gun) I'm the one who shot that flare that saved you.

Mordecai: Where'd you get that? 

Thomas: My mom works for an in-flight magazine. She gets stuff like this for free.

Muscle Man: Ugh! You see, that's just it, Thomas. You're too much of a mama's boy to pull this off.

(Thomas runs to Muscle Man and knocks him down with a kick move.)

Thomas: Still think I'm a mama's boy?

Muscle Man: Uncle! Uncle!

Benson: Alright, what's your plan?

Thomas: (helps Muscle Man up) Alright, the way I see it, it'll take me 30 days to integrate into the park.

(We are shown Pops and Thomas heading to the rival park on Carmenita.)

Thomas (V.O.): I'll infiltrate the park from the air.

(Pops and Thomas nod at each other before Thomas parachutes out of Carmenita to the ground. He starting walking toward the park, changing into costume. He takes out a piece of paper.)

Thomas (V.O.): I'll forge an intern ID and create a whole new persona. My name will be...

(Cut to a close up of the paper.)

Thomas (V.O.): ...Nicholas.

Thomas: I said, "That's not my landlord, that's my lamblord!

Gene: (laughs and shakes hands) You're alright, kid.

(Day 2.)

Thomas (V.O.): I'll embed myself behind enemy lines and play the role of an East Pines intern.

("Nicholas" and a bunch of other interns get their heads shaved. They are shown standing in line while Gene paces with a grin.)

Thomas (V.O.): I'll gain the other interns' trust by getting them snacks and doing all their work for em'.

(Getting an intern a coffee and asking them to do their walkie talkie job. He then fills up gas for the carts to cover for two other interns. He then cleans the East Pines phone for another intern.)

Thomas (V.O.) Once everyone's comfortable with me, I'll be free to wander the park and get a lay of the land, to figure out where they hid the statue.

("Nicholas" opens the door releasing three chickens coming out, Later "Nicholas" was shoveling as Gene walks in)

Gene: How you liking field work?

Thomas: It's just fine, sir.

Gene: Wanna know a secret? (He gives Thomas a secret and points at the silo and then laughs and so does "Nicholas")

Thomas: Good one sir.

(Gene walks as Thomas snaps the photo of a silo)

(Day 11)

(Thomas jumps inside the observatory and removes the white cloths to see the statue)

(Day 25)

(We see Thomas behind the rock holding a binocular to see the training ground)

Thomas: I won't lie to you, this mission is highly dangerous, If I'm found out they'll almost sure to prank me mercilessly, but for the park I think it's worth it.

(Day 30)

Thomas: I'll keep a close eye on what they do and memorize the schedule, so I can pin point the perfect night to steal the statue. At the end of the 30th night watch for my signal. (Thomas fires a flare gun straight at the sky releasing the flare)

Benson: He pulled it off. Let's go.

(We skip to see the park employees see the box, Benson picked it up to see the East Pines uniform)

Rigby: Look a note! Put these on and meet by the front gate of Gene's park, and hurry, there isn't much time.

(The gang in their East Pine uniforms run out of the bush to see the East Pine van, Thomas opens the back door of the van)

Thomas: Let's go get us a statue. (They drive to the East Pines Park) Alright, Gene and his men are at the Park Managers Formal. That should give us about an hour to retrieve the statue and get out.

Benson: Nobody invited me to the park managers formal!

(He turns the van to the left in front of the gate)

Thomas: Shh, quiet, we're here.

(The gate opens Thomas starts the van then stops to talk to one of the East Pine worker)

Jeff: Nicholas, what are you doing? Interns's lights out at nine P.M. and you know that.

Thomas: Yeah, well you know, the boss had me out running errands. It's always something, right?

Jeff: Heh, you can say that again, you have a good night.

Thomas: You do the same boss.

(The van droves off Thomas checks the mirror view see the guard closing the gate)

Benson: I still can't believe that they didn't invite me to the park managers formal!

Muscle Man: You need to work on your networking skills bro.

(Thomas pulls the van over next the observatory, and we cut the scene to see Thomas pulls a tree branch placing it on the van full of tree branch).

Thomas: Alright, you three stay here and wait for my signal, the rest of you follow me.

(Thomas, Mordecai, Skips, Benson and Muscle Man run to the silo as Thomas throws the rope hook on top of the window of the observatory)

Thomas: The statue is in the silo, (They climb all the way on top) And the only way is through the top.

Jeff: Full house baby, read em and weep.

Guard #2: Aw come on man! I'm gonna go prank the interns.

Jeff: Alright, better luck next time.

(Guard #2 walks outside with the flashlight, next we see the gang are inside the silo where the statue is, then the East Pine workers sleeping in their beds then Guard #2 opens the door, holding a garbage lid and a spoon he hits the spoon with a garbage lid waking the workers up)

Guard #2: Rise and shine ladies! (Laughs) Yeah heh heh, I just pranked you guys good.

(The Guard #2 walks next to "Nicholas bed and discovers it's not him)

Guard #2: Oh no!

(We cut to see the park managers formal with all park managers dancing with their girls, Gene was seen dancing with his girlfriend and suddenly his phone rings)

Gene: I'm sorry sweetie, just give me a minute will ya. (He picks up his phone) I told you not to call me tonight!

Guard #2: Sir, it's Nicholas!

(Gene was shock he went back to the park fast, removes the covers to see it's not Nicholas it was just a bunch of pillows and a basketball attached with two toilet paper rolls)

Gene: Oh my!

(We skip to see Muscle Man riding a moving vehicle and carries the statue, the gang push the statue safety and almost fall down).

Muscle Man: I got it, I got it.

(He drives the moving vehicle with statue)

Thomas: We gotta hurry! He'll be back any minute.

(Thomas opens the door and we see Gene and men are here)

Gene: You almost had me fooled, Nicholas.

(The guys shocked)

Benson: It's our statue Gene.

Gene: As long as it's in my park it's my statue, maybe I should just call some back up to teach you that lesson.

(He picks up a device)

Thomas: I wouldn't do that if I were you.

Gene: No intern tells me what to do!

Thomas: I'm not your intern, I'm their intern.

Gene: Hmph. Touching.

(He press the red button, which explodes the barrels)

Thomas: Come on, let's go! (They jump on the moving vehicle with the statue and takes off, they made it towards the van) Just get in the truck and stay down!

(They put the statue inside the van and Thomas accelerate the van)

Gene: Get to the golf carts!

(They run to their carts Guard #2 try to drive but suddenly it's not moving)

Guard #2: There is no gas on these things!

Gene: What?!

(Thomas stops at the gate)

Thomas: Play it cool, Muscle Man.

Gene: Give me your walkie talkie, Jeff! Come in Jeff. (He looks behind his walkie talkie and finds out there are no batteries) There's no batteries in here!

Intern: There's no batteries in mine either, sir.

Gene: We're gonna have to use the emergency phone.

(Cuts to Gate)(Jeff walks in and turns on his flashlight)

Jeff: Nicholas what are you doing out again, and who's this?

Muscle Man: Uh... I... uh?

Thomas: He's the maintenance guy from this morning, and Gene just called me and asked me to give him a lift home. It's always something, right?

Muscle Man: Yeah, it's always something, right?

Jeff: You have to verify this with Gene cause this is the first I'm hearing this. (He picks up a Walkie Talkie) Gene, this is Jeff, coming over.

Rigby: He knows!

(Mordecai punches Rigby. We cut to the scene to see Gene opens the Emergency Phone and picks up)

Gene: This is Gene calling all personnel, hello? (He finds out the wire on the phone is cut off) Wait a minute.

(Gene started to remember in his flashback, Thomas was seen cutting wire of the emergency phone off with a knife, he was then seen putting batteries in the walkie talkie then throws the batteries on the floor, next he use the knife cutting the wires of on one of the East Pines cart. After the flashback ends Gene drop the phone and smash into pieces on the floor and screams Nicholas)

Gene: NICHOLAS!!!!!!!!!

Jeff: Hello Gene? Uh he's not answering.

Thomas: Look the guys tried he's been working all day, just let me take him back and I'll explain to Gene later.

Jeff: Nah... There's something funny going on here. I want both of you step out of the vehicle right now.

Rigby: Forget the statue and let's get out of here.

Jeff: (He picks up the gun) What was that?!

Thomas: What was what?

Jeff: I heard something.

Thomas: I don't know what you're talking about? Just let me call Gene on my phone and he'll verify this.

Jeff: Alright, go ahead, but don't try anything funny.

Mordecai: (whispers) What's he doing? It's not gonna work!

(Gene and his men are seen running after the van, then Thomas picks up his phone)

Thomas: Hey Gene, it's Nicholas requesting clearance for the maintenance guy (giggles) Yeah, he's being difficult. (to Jeff) Here he is.

(He shows his phone to Jeff.)

Gene on Thomas' Phone: Let him through, you blockhead!

Jeff: Oh uh.. I'm sorry sir, my mistake.

(Jeff runs in park gate presses the red button and opens the gate)

Gene: Stop! Stop! Don't let them through!

Mordecai: It's Gene!

Jeff: Oh no!

(Jeff presses the red button again trying to close the gate but Thomas accelerates the van passing through the gate as the guys scream except Thomas the van get few scratches from the gate closing as Jeff watches Gene and his men running.)

Gene: No!

(Gene and his men try to get to the van but are too late as it already got out and they get away with the statue as Gene kneels on the ground.)

Gene: NICHOLAS!!!!!!!!!

(We cut the scene to see the tow truck lowing the statue back we're it belongs as the guys cheer.)

Benson: (Sighs) Sit tight, Curtis Montgomery, you're safe at home, I'm sorry I doubted you. Thomas.

Thomas: Ah. Don't worry about it.

Rigby: How did you do that when Gene answered your phone call?

Thomas: Oh, I had his voice recorded from earlier.

(He picks up his phone and plays the voice again)

Gene: "Let him through, you blockhead!"

Skips: Impressive.

Muscle Man: Pretty cool, but you'll always be a momma's boy to me.

(Thomas does his fighting stance again. Muscle Man squeals and then everyone laughs as Thomas' phone rings.)

Thomas: Alright guys, I gotta get this. See ya later.

(The guys say bye to Thomas as he answers the phone)

Thomas: Hey Mom, good news. They want me to stay at the park. Yep, mission accomplished.

Quips: What do you get when you put a ball with a chain? Two people getting married. (Skips smiles) Zin-

(Skips flips the card over. He discovers that it is an invitation to the wedding of Quips and Monica.)

Skips: Hey, Quips is getting married. Aww.

(He hears knocking and answers the door)

Quips: You get the invite, cous?

Skips: Uh, yeah.

Quips: Good. I was so excited that I had it sent overnight at great expense.

Skips: Well, eh, congratulations. I can't wait to meet the lucky lady.

Quips: And she can't wait to meet the (Pokes chest) "best man", buddy.

Skips: Best man?

(Quips puts a "Best Man" cap on Skips and waves flags around while blowing into a party favor)

Quips: But in all honesty, Skips, I don't have a lot of friends. So I need you to be my best man. Anyway, what's a composer's favorite kind of party?

Skips: So what do I gotta do?

Quips: You gotta throw me a "Bachelor" party! I just changed the joke up on the fly to answer your question.

Skips: Bachelor party? I've never done one of those before.

Quips: Oh, you'll do great. I just have one request.

Skips: Huh?

Quips: At the end of the night, I wanna eat "wings on a hill" with my best buds. Well, your best buds. Hey, can I borrow your best buds? Just to reiterate, I don't have any friends.

Skips: Sure, no problem.

Quips: Thanks, best man. Or should I say, "chest man"? (Pats Skips's chest) Badabadabadaba zingo! Hey, can you spot me for a cab home?

(Cut to Pops' House, where Mordecai and Rigby are laughing. They are in the kitchen.)

Mordecai: Sack lunch!

Rigby: Sack lunch!

(They laugh while putting sacks on the table)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Slapping sacks together) Lunch! Lunch! Lunch! Lunch!

(They stop when they hear Skips on the phone)

Skips: No, what do you mean you're closed for a private party?

Wing Kingdom Manager: Well, exactly what I said. We're closed for a private party today. You're gonna have to get your wings somewhere else.

(Skips grunts and hangs up)

Mordecai: What's the matter, Skips?

Rigby: You want some licorice, bro?

Skips: Wing Kingdom is closed, and I need to get wings for a bachelor party.

(Muscle Man bursts in with Hi Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Did some- (Stops to catch his breath) -Did somebody say "bachelor party"?

Skips: I don't know the first thing about bachelor parties.

Muscle Man: You just gotta do a bunch of crazy stuff to celebrate your bro's last night of freedom.

Skips: But isn't he already in a long-term monogamous relationship?

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other) 

Rigby: Maybe we should help.

(He eats some licorice as Mordecai begins to speak.)

Mordecai: So who's it for?

Skips: My cousin, Quips.

Guys: Uhh....

Rigby: Well, it's...still a bachelor party.

Muscle Man: Still a bachelor party.

Mordecai: It's still a bachelor party.

Rigby: And there'll be wings.

Muscle Man: And there'll be wings.

Mordecai: And there'll be wings. We'll take care of everything, Skips. All you gotta worry about is the wings.

Skips: Thanks, guys.

(Cut to Quips performing as a clown at a birthday party)

Quips: What animal is like an insect that secretly gets married? An antelope!

Kid #1: Boo!

Kid #2: Don't quit your day job!

Quips: This is my day job. Ahem. What do you get if you-

Kid #1: Get off the stage, loser!

Quips: Whew, tough crowd.

(Gets punched in the chest by Kid #1)

Quips (continued): Really..tough crowd.

(Another kid puts a paper bag over his head)

Quips (continued): What the--

(Kid grabs him)

Quips (continued): Where are you taking me?!

Kid #1: (To frightened kids) You don't tell anybody what you saw!

(The kids only quiver in fear and look at each other. The scene then cuts to Quips, who is in the middle of having the paper bag removed. The camera zooms out, revealing the three children who kidnapped Quips. Quips quickly begins to beg for mercy.)

Quips: Please... spare my life! Take anything you want!

(The kid who put the paper bag over Quips's head unzips his costume, revealing a well disguised Rigby. Quips smiles in response.)

Quips (continued): Ahhhhhh.....

(He turns to look at the other two kids, who are really just Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost in disguise. They begin laughing.)

Quips (continued): Oh, no....

(Muscle Man attaches a ball and chain to Quips's leg)

Quips (continued): It's really happening!

(Mordecai rolls down a window and smiles)

Mordecai: Welcome to your bachelor party, dude.

Quips: Wow!

(Looks around excitedly)

Quips (continued): Am I in a limo?

(The camera then focuses on Skips, who is up front in the passenger seat. He is on the phone, trying to get ahold of a place that sells wings.)

Skips: No wings? At all? 

(Hangs up)

Skips (continued): (Frustrated) Oh, why'd today have to be National Wing Day?

(He crosses out Thighs Guys on his list of wing joints. Quips suddenly appears behind him, a big grin plastered on his face.)

Quips: Skips, this is a dream come true! Thanks for--(Throws up his hands)--No, wait. I'm gonna tell this to everyone.

(He sits back down and addresses everybody in the room)

Quips (continued): Thanks, everybody. This really means a lot. Now, enough with the conversation- let's start the (Points) celebration!

(Thrusts his arms back against his sides)

Quips (continued): Zingooooooo! Come on, guys; zingo with me.

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Mordecai: (Shrugs) Bachelor party, dude.

All (except Skips): Zingooooo!

(A montage of the bachelor party begins. Mordecai is shown concentrating before rolling a bowling ball and knocking down all ten pins. Rigby rolls next, managing to get a strike as well. Quips walks up next, determined to knock down some pins. The camera quickly pans over to the pins as he takes his turn, although they don't seem to be affected by his roll. The camera pans back over to Quips, who realizes that he was trying to roll the ball that was attached to his ankle. The camera then proceeds to zoom in on Skips, who is on the phone trying to contact a wing joint. He frowns and crosses out Wicky Wild Wild Wings on his list. Quips is then seen riding in a bumper car, a big smile on his face. In the car right behind him, Skips is on the phone once again, a look of worry evident on his face. He scribbles out Guess Who's Coming To Winger? on his list. The scene then transitions to a paintball fight. Quips puts down his protective face mask and blasts Skips with paint. Skips seems to be unaware of what is happening as he continues to speak on the phone. He crosses out Ding-A-Wings on his list. The scene changes to a Carter and Briggs stuntman tryout. Briggs is seen winking at Quips before Quips does donuts in the limo. Meanwhile, Skips crosses out Wingin' It And Blingin' It on his list. Quips is then shown standing on top of an alligator as the guys look on. Skips crosses out Wing Suit Riot, 12 Angry Wings, and If You Like It Put A Wing On It on his list. Rigby, Muscle Man, Fives and Quips are then heard shouting "Zingo!" as they stick their head out of the limo's sunroof. Skips is also shown dejectedly staring at his list, for all of the wing joints in town are out of wings. The montage ends with a clock transition.)

Quips: Man, this bachelor party's been perfect! Speaking about perfect bachelor parties, (points at Skips) how's those wings coming, Skips?

Skips: Uh, yeah of course, uh, but uh... (Shrugs) bachelor party rules! Time for the, uh... blindfold activity!

(Quips gasps as Mordecai ties a blindfold around Quips's head)

Quips: (Excitedly) Just like in the movies!

Skips: Uh, Mordecai and Rigby.... (Points) could I see you privately for a second?

(Mordecai and Rigby are then seen opening one of the limo's doors)

Mordecai: What's up, Skips?

(They enter the limo)

Rigby: How's the wing search?

Skips: I called every place in town. There's no wings anywhere! What should I do?

Mordecai and Rigby: (Look at each other) Uh....

Mordecai: You gotta try Wing Kingdom again.

Rigby: Yeah; maybe the private party's over!

Skips: Worth a shot.

(The limo is seen driving up to Wing Kingdom. Skips skips into the restaurant and addresses the manager.)

Skips (continued): Uh, excuse me; I'd like a few dozen wings.

Wing Kingdom Manager: We're closed for a private party.

Skips: It's for my cousin! Can't you just spare a few?

Wing Kingdom Manager: Sorry, sir. They're animals in there.

(He gestures to another room, where the private party is being held. Loud screams and breaking glass can be heard.)

Wing Kindom Manager (continued): (Shrugs) I can't spare a single wing.

Skips: (Begging) Please! 

(Grabs the manager's shoulders) 

Skips (continued): I'm the best man! I can't let him down!

Wing Kingdom Manager: Pffft. Some best man. 

(Begins to walk away)

Wing Kingdom Manager (continued): Can't even find a few wings.

(Skips sighs and worriedly grabs a Wing Kingdom bag, stuffing napkins into it. Cut back to Quips and the guys in the limo.)

Quips: That's a great idea!

(Skips joins them)

Quips (continued): You got those wings, best man?

Skips: Uh, yep.

Quips: You know, "Wings on a Hill" is a Quippenger tradition.

Skips: Is....that....so?

Quips: You bet. My dad did it with his friends, my grandfather did it, and now me with my bros and my best man carrying on the tradition. All this wing talk is making me hungry. (Clasps and rubs his stomach) How long 'till wing time?

Skips: Uh...it's coming.

Quips: Well, can I at least have a whiff to tide me over?

Skips: I don't think that-

(Quips grabs the bag of "wings" and shakes it)

Quips: Huh, a lighter than I thought it'd be.

Skips: Uhh....

(Quips sniffs the inside.)

Quips: Not much of a scent....What flavor is this?

Skips: Uhh, the best one. Why don't you give me that back?

Quips: Maybe if I just take a peek.

(Quips removes his blindfold and peeks)

Skips: Wait!

(Quips sees that there are napkins in place of the wings)

Quips: Is this some kinda joke?

Skips: Uh, listen...

Quips: Because if it is, you should say, "Zingo". Because people might get the wrong idea if you don't say "Zingo" after the hilarious joke.

Skips: Let me explain.

Quips: (Begins to whimper) Very funny, Skips!

(Rigby places a hand on Quips)

Rigby: Come on, try and calm down.

(Quips motions himself away from Rigby's hand)

Quips: You don't understand. The only Quippenger who didn't eat "wings on a hill" was left at the altar!

(Quips buries his head in his hands and cries)

Skips: Quips, I'm sorry. I tried everywhere.

Muscle Man: Ahem. Not everywhere, bro.

(Scene cuts to a night sky in a bayou where fireflies fly everywhere. A fly flutters by, then a frog eats the fly, and then a dragonfly picks up the frog and flies away.)

Mordecai: "Wings For Real Men"?

Rigby: Yeah, we can read.

(They walk on a bridge to a small restaurant)

Muscle Man: This place is really off the grid. Real hush-hush. They take their wings super seriously.

(They go inside the "Wings For Real Men" restaurant to find no one there)

Skips: Hello?

(Someone opens the door. Skips and Quips look at each other. A guy with a beard, a guy eating wings, and a chef walk up to them.)

Guy #1: Well, lookie here! We got several fancy city folk, from the biiig city!

Skips: I need a bucketa wings to go.

Guy #1: You walk in here with your fancy pants, running water, your electricity, and your special-edition DVDs, and expect us to give you our buckets?!

Skips: What about that?

(There is a sign that says "Inferno Wing Challenge - Free Wings for Life")

Skips (continued): (Grabs sign) Free wings for life, huh?

Guy #1: Oh, you wouldn't be able to handle those. They're for real men.

Mordecai: We're men!

Muscle Man: No women here.

Hi Five Ghost: I haven't seen a woman all day.

Guy #1: Nobody's ever survived the Inferno Challenge!

(We are shown "people who died trying the Inferno Challenge") (In the UK, the sign shows "People who stopped living trying the Inferno Challenge". due to the word "died" being too inappropriate. This censor is also used in Australia.)

Guy #1: Our wing sauce is made from mutated ghost peppers, hot magma extract, and black widow venom.

Skips: I'll do it.

(A plate, a towelette, a bucket of wings, and blue cheese dip are set up for Skips)

Guy #2: But you don't get the blue cheese!

(The chef whacks it against the wall, where a bunch of other blue cheese containers lay)

Guy #3: You got two minutes to eat that whole bucket.

(Skips picks up an Inferno wing. Some sauce drops from the wing and burns through the table. Skips and the guys gasp.)

Quips: Skips, don't do it! Maybe being left at the altar won't be so bad!

Skips: I promised you those wings, and you're gonna get 'em.

(Skips starts the timer. He cools off the first wing, then eats it. He breathes out hot breath and drops the bone. He cools off the second wing, and begins to bite, when the sauce causes pain in his mouth. The guys gasp. Skips sticks out his tongue, which is burning from the sauce. The three guys laugh at this. Skips grabs a third wing and cools it off before eating it. He groans in pain. After a large round of wings, Skips's body is all hot and scruffy.)

Guy #1: Tick-tock, city boy! Ain't that what your fancy watches say?

(Skips groans and reaches back into the bucket for another wing)

Mordecai: Come on, Skips! You're almost there!

(As Mordecai says this, the camera focuses back onto Skips, who is severely scruffy and shaken up)

Mordecai (continued): (Voice slows down) Just three more wings...

(The camera pans around to everybody in the room, including the amused chef and his men and an anxious looking Quips. The camera then focuses back on the bucket, which is almost flaming in anticipation. Skips picks up another wing and groans before blacking out. He is then seen waking up in an actual inferno.)

Skips: Huh?

(He looks at his surroundings. Some strange beings are then seen marching nearby.) 

Zingos: (Chanting) Zingo, zingo, zingo, zingo, zingo!

(They menacingly loom over Skips, who looks up in surprise)

Zingo #1: We are the zingos. (Hisses) This... is the inferno!

Skips: I... I gotta... finish this! 

(Before he can do so, however, Zingo #1 knocks him off of the miniature cliff they are standing on)

Zingo #1: Never!

(Skips slides down the cliff and manages to hang onto a piece of celery. He then looks down at the river of blue cheese below him. The zingos slide down the cliff and land right in front of Skips, almost knocking him into the estuary of dressing. One of the zingos stomps on Skips's hand, almost causing him to lose his grip. He moans in pain and somehow manages to hold on.)

Zingo #1: You've let down your own family!

(He roars and attempts to stomp on Skips's hand again, but Skips manages to grab hold of his leg and stop him)

Skips: (Determined) He's gonna get those wings!

(He throws the zingo over the edge of the cliff. Zingo #1 manages to land on a piece of cliff that had broken off in the middle of the river. He looks up angrily at Skips in response. Skips then proceeds to leap into the air and knock the other two zingos' heads together, providing him with enough time to bite one of the zingos. The zingo screams in agony before turning into a regular chicken wing, which Skips consumes. He spits out the bones, which end up piercing the other zingo in the side. It screams in pain as Skips skips over and punches it in the face. The zingo in turn manages to punch Skips back, but in doing so, Skips latches onto his arm and bites it. The zingo screams again before turning into a regular wing as well. SKips bites into it successfully before noticing Zingo #1 in the river.)

Zingo #1: (Tauntingly) Zingo. Zingo! Zingo, zingo, zingo.

(Skips hops down from the cliff and lands on one of the cliff fragments floating in the river. He hops from fragment to fragment until he manges to land on the same piece the zingo is standing on. Zingo #1 and Skips begin to punch one another, each delivering a few good blows until the zingo leaps behind Skips and catches him by surprise. Zingo #1 manages to knock Skips over, and shortly after doing so, he wraps his arm around Skips and holds him captive.)

Zingo #1: (continued): You failed him, Skips. Just like you failed Desdemona!

Skips: Noooooo!

(Skips wraps his arms around the zingo and thrusts him in front of his own body, right before they meet up with a blue cheese waterfall. Zingo #1 screams "zingo" one last time before being drenched in blue cheese dressing. He immediately explodes and turns into a regular wing, which Skips eats. The inferno is then seen being doused with rain. Skips victoriously shouts "zingo"  and sighs in relief. He is then shown back in the real world, where he is being doused with lemonade while the guys cheer him on.)

Quips: You did it.

Skips: (Points over at the chef and his men) Now hand over the wings!

Guy #1: Didn't you read the fine print?

(He hands over the picture of the Inferno Wing Challenge and laughs. Skips dusts off the layer of filth covering the fine print, which reads: "Except if'n you're fancy.")

Guy #1 (continued): We don't gotta give you no nothing! No how! So why don't you pack up your big city friends, and your big city shaved chest, and hightail it outta-

(Skips punches him before he can finish)

Skips: Run!

(Skips, with the wings in hand, runs out of the restaurant with Quips and the guys)

Guy #1: Curse you, big city shaved chest!

(The restaurant cracks off the bridge and sinks into the lake)

Guy #1: You're gonna pay for this!

(Cut to the sunrise at the park, where Quips, Skips, and the guys are eating wings)

Quips: Thanks, Skips. That was the best night of my life.

Skips: Ahh, it's what best men do.

(A car drives up to them)

Quips: (Sitting up) Monica!

(The front window rolls down, revealing Monica in the driver's seat)

Monica: Hello, everyone.

Quips: How was your bachelorette party, babe?

Monica: Well, we rented out Wing Kingdom and we ate wings there all night. I had a very good time.

Quips: Haha. (To guys) See? That's why she's gonna wear my "wedding wing"!

(The guys all pump their arms)

Quips and guys: Zingo!

CJ: Here are the hotdog and some more supplies, tarp, extra stakes...

Eileen: First aid kit, length of rope, and hank-crank radio for emergencies.

CJ: And here's the regular radio.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan tiredly)

CJ (continued): C'mon you guys, camping! Get excited.

Eileen: I know it's early, but if we do this now, you can have the campsite set up by the time CJ and I get off work.

(Mordecai and Rigby are sleeping while holding the supplies. CJ clasp her hands loudly, waking them up.)

CJ: Just focus for a sec. (points) There's the sleeping bags and the cooler. There's my new tent.

Mordecai: Woah. You got the "Camp Champ Deluxe"?

CJ: Yeah. When I found out you guys liked camping, I decided to splurge on it. It's so awesome. All you have to do is unzip it and it pitches itself.

Mordecai: Nice.

(CJ kisses Mordecai on the cheek. Eileen just watches Rigby drooling before walking away. CJ and Eileen walk over to Eileen car.)

CJ: See you guys up there.

(They drive off.)

Rigby: Dude, hit the snooze button.

Mordecai: Aww! C'mon, let's get this stuff in the cart.

(Mordecai starts driving the golf cart backwards to get the stuff on it. Rigby is leading him.)

Rigby: You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good. You're good.

(Mordecai accidentally runs over CJ's tent.)

Rigby (continued): Bad! You're bad!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Too far! Pull up!

(He pulls up, ripping the tent.)

Rigby (continued): Aaah! No!

Mordecai: Back more?

(He goes back more.)

Rigby: Gah! Forward! Forward!

(A tent pole snaps as he moves forward, off the tent. He comes out.)

Mordecai: Ugh! I don't know what you're trying to say. Gah! CJ's tent!

(He picks up the now damaged tent.)

Mordecai (continued): Dude, she said it was brand new and now it's totally wrecked! We gotta fix this.

Rigby: Just throw it in the trash and say someone stole it. Do we even need a tent?

(Mordecai punches him.)

Rigby: Aww!

Mordecai: It's not just about needing a tent. It's that it's CJ's tent. She'd be really bummed if she found out we broke it. We have to replace it.

Rigby: You're right, you're right. We should replace the tent. But we have to get breakfast tacos, right?

(Mordecai walks off. Rigby follows)

Rigby (continued): Drive-through?

(Mordecai and Rigby go to Outdoorz & Morez, a camping shop. Mordecai talks to an employee)

Mordecai: Hey, uhh, (referring to the wrecked tent) we want a non-crushed version of this, please.

Salesman: Oh yeah, you want the Camp Champ Deluxe. It's right over there.

(Pans to where the tent is kept. There is a model of the set-up tent, plus 3 boxes of it. The price shown is $20 on special, but it shows $200 near the boxes. We get a close up of the"$20 on Special" sign.)

Mordecai: 20 bucks? Oh, good. I thought it was gonna be like 200 do-

(The "On Special" signs falls. The real price is $200.00.)

Mordecai (continued): $200?!

Salesman: Yeah, I know, it's a pretty big rip-off. Doesn't even fit one person.

Mordecai: I don't have $200.

Rigby: Come on, can't you give him a discount? He ran over his girlfriend's tent.

(Mordecai punches him again.)

Rigby (continued): Ow!

Salesman: Yeah...I'll be in the Trail Mix aisle if you need me.

(He grabs trail mix from the aisle and eats. Rigby turns to Mordecai.)

Rigby: Can't you just say you're really sorry?

Mordecai: "Really sorry" doesn't replace a $200 tent. Come on.

(He walks off. Cut to Pops' house. Benson is in his office. Someone knocks on his door.)

Benson: Yeah?

(Mordecai and Rigby come inside.)

Mordecai: Hey, Benson.

Benson: (not looking) What is it?

Mordecai: We just realized that you need somebody to trim the hedges 'cause they're lookin' pretty shabby.

Rigby: Wicked shabby!

Mordecai: Yeah, they look really bad. We also just noticed that we need $200. So if you have the $200, we can just go trim those hedges for you right now.

Rigby: Or tomorrow.

(Mordecai punches him again.)

Benson: The hedges are fine. Wait, why are you even here? I thought you were going camping.

Mordecai: Uh -

(Benson raises his eyebrow)

Mordecai: I broke CJ's tent and need money to replace it.

Benson: No.

Mordecai: What? Why not?

Benson: Maybe because every time I give you extra work, it never gets done!

Rigby: Well maybe if you gave us jobs that weren't so boring...

Benson: Argh! If you need extra money so badly, just go get a part-time job!

Rigby: But that's like even more and more work!

Benson: You could just tell CJ the truth?

Mordecai: Hmm...mhm, mhm...Benson, look out behind you!

Benson: Huh? What?

(Benson turns his head to notice Mordecai and Rigby driving off in the Cart. A montage begins set to "Takin' Care of Business" by Bachman Turner Overdrive, of the duo trying out part-time jobs. First, they try out working at a hot dog stand. Rigby gets hot so scoops up some of the hot dog grease in a cup and drinks it. Mordecai, grossed out, accidentally squeezes two buns together, causing the sausage to fly out and get stuck in their customer's nostril. The guys run off, as we transition to their next job, holding signs to point towards a business. Rigby shows off and throws his sign into the road, causing a collision, making them run off again. Their next job is as valets at a valet park. Rigby takes keys from a fancy couple, and throws them over to Mordecai, who is standing by the key stand. Mordecai isn't able to catch the keys in time however, and falls into the stand, knocking all the keys to the ground. A gang of scruffy hooligans quickly run and take the keys, stealing all the cars. Mordecai and Rigby run off again, taking us to their next job at a crocodile lake. The duo try to feed the crocodile some T-boned steak, but it jumps out and eats the entire shovel it was being served on, causing them to run off. Their next job is at a restaurant called Marv's Grill. They seem to be doing well, with Rigby as a waiter and Mordecai as a cook, until we cut to a shot of the restaurant on fire, most likely thanks to them. Their final job is at a bed store, where they are trying to show a woman around. They end up jumping on one of the beds, and Rigby bounces into her chest, presumably getting them fired. Cut to the Park Snack Bar, where Muscle Man is working, and the duo are trying to look for more part-time jobs in a newspaper.)

Mordecai: Are they any jobs left?

Rigby: Just military recruit and lumberjacks.

(Mordecai's phone rings)

Mordecai: Dude, it's CJ!

Rigby: Pick it up!

(Mordecai answers the phone)

Rigby: Make sure not to tell her about the tent.

(Mordecai slaps Rigby across the face)

Mordecai: Hey..how's it going?

CJ: Did you guys set up the tent yet?

Mordecai: No, not yet! We're still just stuck here at the Park.

CJ: Oh, okay! Well can you just text me a picture of the tent anyway? I wanna remember what it looks like in the bag.

Mordecai: What? Uh...

(Mordecai grabs Rigby's newspaper and scrunches it up)

Mordecai: I'm losing you, CJ! We're driving through a tunnel. See you on the mountain!

(Mordecai hangs up and groans)

Rigby: Dude, I was still reading that.

Mordecai: Forget about the paper! How are we gonna get the $200?

(Muscle Man starts clearing his throat loudly)

Muscle Man: Did you say $400?

Mordecai: No, I said 200.

Muscle Man: Oh. Well, I gotta way you can make that too.

Rigby: We're listening.

Muscle Man: The Side Line holds a mud wrestling competition twice a month.

Mordecai & Rigby: Mud wrestling?

Muscle Man: Yeah, if you can last five minutes against Starla and her sister, Peggy - the money's yours!

Mordecai: Five minutes? That's it?

Muscle Man: You might feel differently in the ring, but if you think you can last...

Rigby: Oh, I think we can! Mordecai?

Mordecai: Let's go get that money.

(Cut to The Side Line; Mordecai and Rigby are stretching)

Mordecai: Sure are a lot of people here.

Muscle Man: Yeah, mud sports fans are pretty passionate.

Mud Sports Fans: Mud! Mud! Mud!

Rigby: It's just Starla and her sister, it can't be that bad!

(The lights dim as a spotlight appears over the MC in the ring)

MC: Welcome to...Mud Mania!

(Everybody cheers)

MC: Put your hands together and your mud ponchos on for...your two favorite misses of mess - The Mud Angels: Peggy and Starla!

(A door opens, revealing both Starla and Peggy. They move towards the ring, and throw mud on fans. A showreel of their victories is shown on one of the screens, even showing characters from Season 2's "Really Real Wrestling", Hissy Fit, Four-Armageddon, and Huge Head. Mordecai and Rigby look at the showreel in fear. They turn around to see Benson, Pops, Skips, Hi Five Ghost and Thomas walking towards them)

Benson: Hope you guys aren't having second thoughts, 'cause we all paid good money to see you in that ring!

Mordecai & Rigby: What?

Skips: Yeah, once Muscle Man told us, we couldn't miss it!

Pops: Mud is such a novel idea!

(Mordecai and Rigby groan, as the MC makes an announcement)

MC: Now, let's meet tonight's challengers: Mordecai and Rigby!

(Mordecai and Rigby exchange looks, then climb into the ring)

MC: Remember, this is an unsanctioned fight at a two-star restaurant. We are not liable for any injuries or deaths.

(Mordecai nods towards the MC, then huddles into Rigby)

Mordecai: Okay, dude. Just don't let them touch you. We don't need to fight, all that matters is that we're still standing after five minutes.

Rigby: Hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph, hmph!

Starla: Uh, we can hear you?

Peggy: This is our house!

Starla: But it's gonna be your grave!

(Starla and Peggy laugh, then high five each other. Mordecai and Rigby gulp)

MC: Alright, to your places!

(Rigby and Starla exit the ring, for Mordecai and Peggy to fight)

MC: Ready...set...let's get muddy!

(The bell rings declaring the start of the fight. Peggy runs towards Mordecai, who quickly jumps into some mud to dodge her. He runs in circles around the ring, as she chases him)

Rigby: Keep it up, man! That tent money is ours!

(Mordecai stops for a second to give Rigby a thumbs up, but then slips into the ground)

Mordecai: Huh?

(Peggy jumps onto Mordecai's back with her elbow)

Park Gang: Ooh!

Skips: That looked pretty painful.

Benson: Sure did.

(Benson opens up a can of soda and drinks it. In the ring, Mordecai is being beaten up by Peggy)

Starla: Take him down, Peg'!

(Peggy crushes Mordecai's stomach. He groans in pain)

MC: We're less than a minute into this, but it looks like time could be up for the challengers!

Rigby: Mordecai! Tag me in, tag me in! Tag me! Tag me!

(Mordecai tags in Rigby, as Peggy drops a chair onto his back. He slides out of the ring groaning)

Rigby: Don't worry, man! I got this.

Mordecai: Hmph...

(Rigby enters the ring with Starla. His feet sink into the mud)

Rigby: Grr...I'm not afraid of you!

(Starla kicks Rigby across the ring, breaking his ribs as he lands)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: My ribs made a breaking sound!

(Starla drags Rigby away by his feet, then stands over him)

Starla: Welcome to pain town, population: you!

(Starla sits on Rigby's back, crushing his bones even more. Rigby screams in agony)

Muscle Man: Isn't she great?

(Starla throws Rigby into the edge, then climbs onto a barrier, and jumps off onto Rigby with her stomach in slow-motion. Rigby screams and isn't able to blink in time, as Starla's stomach sweat drips into Rigby's eye. Rigby climbs from under Starla's stomach, gasping for breath)

Rigby: My eyes! She touched my eyes! Couldn't blink in time - my eyes!

(While Rigby is crying, Starla climbs onto the barrier to repeat her stunt again. Rigby quickly notices and screams, jumping out of the way, making Starla miss and face-plant into the mud)

MC: Looks like a miss for our angel!

(Starla growls as she lifts her face from the mud. Meanwhile, Rigby is slipping up on the mud trying to run away. Starla takes advantage and pushes Rigby over, but Rigby quickly jumps into the ropes, bouncing him onto Starla's back. He grabs onto her as Mordecai gasps. Starla tries to shake him off)

Starla: Hey! Get off me!

Mordecai: Haha, Rigby!

(Starla runs around with Rigby attached to her back)

MC: The Mud Angels' undefeated title could be in jeopardy!

(Peggy glances at Rigby angrily, and climbs into the ring with a sign)

Peggy: Hey Starla, you got something on your back!

(She bashes Rigby off Starla)

Mordecai: What!? You can't do that!

(Mordecai runs into the ring. Peggy beats Rigby continuously with the sign, as Mordecai runs towards them)

Mordecai: Stop!

(Peggy bashes Mordecai, making him fall onto Rigby)

MC: Folks, the clock is at the half-way mark!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Half-way? It feels like we've been here for hours!

Peggy: Hope you guys like mud pie!

Starla: 'cause we're saving all you can eat!

(Mordecai and Rigby get grabbed by Starla and Peggy, as they slam their heads into the mud. The Park Gang look uncomfortable.

Starla: You two don't look so good!

Peggy: Maybe you should stop wasting your time and give up already!

Starla: Let's finish this, Peg'!

Pops: They only have a minute left!

(Peggy and Starla both jump into the ropes, swinging them towards Mordecai and Rigby, knocking the dudes down. The Mud Angels nod towards each other, and run in circles around Mordecai and Rigby. Their eyes turn red)

MC: Folks! I don't believe it! The legendary sister twister!

(The audience gasps in amazement, as Starla and Peggy's running turns the mud into a mud tornado. Mordecai and Rigby are still laying on the ground, barely conscious)

Rigby: Are we...winning?

Mordecai: Dude...I don't think so...

(They both look up to see the tornado surrounding them, causing them to scream)

MC: It's...beautiful!

(Peggy and Starla jump from the ropes once again, bouncing them into the air. They hold hands and start spinning as they go through the eye of the tornado, towards the duo. Mud splashes everywhere. Mordecai and Rigby are thrown against the ropes, trying to stay standing while being blasted by mud. The bell rings, indicating the end of the match)

MC: Could the challengers even be standing after such a hit?

(Mordecai and Rigby are seen layed up against the ropes)

MC: Uhh, well - technically they're still standing! The challengers: Mordecai and Rigby, win the $200!

(Everybody boos and complains)

Muscle Man: I did not see that coming.

Thomas: I think there's some mud in my mouth.

Peggy: Well I hope it was good for you!

Starla: Hmph!

(Peggy and Starla walk off)

Rigby: Dude...we did it.

Mordecai & Rigby: (exhausted) OOOHHHHHH...

(The guys cough, as the scene transitions to the campsite. CJ and Eileen pull in)

CJ: Alright! Who's reading for some camping?

(CJ and Eileen notice Mordecai and Rigby fully bandaged)

Eileen: Whoa...what happened?

Mordecai: We had trouble with the tent.

CJ: Six. One, two, three, four, five, six. Coyote Flats. I'd like to buy a mine.

(Eileen slowly picks up a card)

Eileen: In the mine, you find...gold!

CJ: Yes!

Mordecai: Aaaaawww...

Eileen: (Flips over the card) Foolsgold!

CJ: Aw, man.

Mordecai, Rigby, and Eileen: Ooooooohhhhh!

Eileen: The scientific name for foolsgold is pyrite.

Mordecai: My turn. (Rolls the dice) C'mon, Papa needs a brand new pickaxe!

(Benson appears in the doorway with a handful of mail)

Benson: Are you gonna take care of this mail? It's been stacked up by the door for weeks.

Rigby: We get mail? (Turns to Mordecai) Did you know this?

Benson: Get it outta there! (He drops the mail) Do it or you're fired! Eileen. Dodgeball girl. (He leaves)

(Rigby picks up a football trophy with a drawing of Rigby's head that says "World Rugby Association"; the "u" in "Rugby" is covered by an "I", spelling "Rigby")

Rigby: Aw, yeah! My order from Trophy Discounters!

Mordecai: (Looks at one of the letters) Couple Corral?

CJ: What?

Eileen: You're still subscribed to that dating site?

Rigby: Dude, you're not single.

CJ: Uh, yeah. (She elbows Mordecai playfully) I deleted my profile.

Mordecai: Hey, I forgot, alright? Okay, everybody watch.

(He takes out his phone)

Voice: Delete profile?

(Mordecai presses "Yes", then a wheel rolls as it's loading)

Mordecai: See, it's being deleted right...

(A gunshot sound is heard as an X appears, then Mordecai looks at his phone)

Voice: Are you sure, pardner?

Mordecai: (Annoyed) Yes!

(He presses "Yes")

Voice: Did you mean to press "No"?

Mordecai: Hold on.

Eileen: So how long have you two been together?

CJ: Hmm. We've been hanging out for a month now.

Rigby: "Hanging out"? "Hanging out"?!

Eileen: Sounds pretty casual, guys. I mean, have you ever been on a nice, romantic date?

Mordecai: This is a date.

Eileen: This is game night, Mordecai. I mean a real date.

Mordecai and CJ: A real date?

CJ: Does that time we had all-you-can-eat crab at Seafood Sal's count?

Rigby and Eileen: No.

CJ: Oh my gosh.

Mordecai: I'm gonna make reservations at a nice restaurant.

CJ: I'm gonna buy a new outfit.

Mordecai: Saturday at seven?

CJ: Saturday at seven.

(Mordecai and CJ run away to make plans to get ready)

Rigby: Hello? Game night?

(A clock transition to the next day. Rigby is playing a video game and Mordecai is holding up a small jewelry box.)

Mordecai: Dude, Rigby, you got a second? I want to show you what I bought for CJ.

Rigby: (He puts down the game controller) Okay, what do you got?

(Rigby opens the box to reveal a bracelet with charms shaped like a shopping cart, a laser gun, a cloud butt, a roller skate, a video game controller, a grilled cheese sandwich, a go-kart, an alligator, and an air hockey mallet.)

Rigby: What is this? What am I looking at?

Mordecai: It's a charm bracelet. There's a different charm for all the stuff CJ and I did the first time we met. (He points to each individual charm) There's a little roller skate and a grilled cheese and an air hockey mallet.

Rigby: Wow, Mordecai! This is the kind of thing that pros get their girlfriends.

Mordecai: Right? I'm just not sure how to give it to her, though.

Rigby: Here's an idea. How about if you say you have something for her, and then you give it to her! (He hands the box to Mordecai) Classic gift-giving technique, bro.

Mordecai: No, dude. I've gotta do it in some way that's really special.

(Benson appears with a handful of mail again)

Benson: What's this?

Mordecai: It looks like-

Benson: No, no, I'll tell you. It's the stack of junk mail I asked you to take care of yesterday!

(Benson tosses the junk mail in Mordecai and Rigby's laps)

Mordecai: But we threw that out!

Benson: Really? You threw this mail that I found not in the trash into the trash?

Mordecai: Wait. This is new junk mail. And it's all from Couple Corral. Man, what is it with these guys? Hey, Benson, do you have any ideas for a romantic way to give a gift to a girl?

Benson: Well... I've always thought it would be nice to have a waiter serve a gift box in place of dessert.

Rigby: Look at you, Benson! How are you still single?

Mordecai: Yeah; that idea's genius.

Benson: (Shrugs) I'm just spitballing here.

Mordecai: Well, thanks for the tip, Benson. I'm gonna go call the restaurant right now.

(As Mordecai dials the restaurant's number on his phone, the scene circle-wipes to the Coffee Shop. Eileen pours a cup of coffee for CJ.)

Eileen: So, big date's tonight, huh?

CJ: Yeah.

Eileen: What kind of place are we talking? Is this an oyster/crackers or a warm rolls establishment?

CJ: I think they might charge extra for bread.

Eileen: Ooh, romantic. (Puts the coffee pot down) So what's your "hes"?

CJ: I'm just not sure it's gonna be enough. This night has to be amazing, you know?

CJ and Eileen: Hmm...

CJ: Maybe I can get a special dessert for Mordecai.

Eileen: Yeah! What does he like?

CJ: Waffles, chocolate...

Eileen: There's a new pastry shop downtown that specializes in chocolate-covered waffle cakes.

CJ: That's perfect! I'll take him there for dessert to surprise him.

Eileen: You just gotta make sure not to fill up on bread at dinner.

(Circle-wipe scene transition to Bistro en le Parc. Mordecai and CJ are sitting at a table near a window.)

CJ: Could this get any more romantic?

Mordecai: Oh, well... maybe. (Sips water from a glass)

(The concierge approaches Mordecai from behind)

Concierge: You have a call at the front.

Mordecai: (He shrugs and rises out of his seat) To be continued.

(Mordecai walks up to the front desk, and the concierge hands him the phone)

Mordecai: Hello?

Matchmaker McIntyre: Matchmaker McIntyre here, CEO of Couple Corral. This is not a recording.

Mordecai: Uh, hi?

McIntyre: We noticed earlier you deleted your profile. So sad to see ya go. We really appreciate your business, so I'm beggin' ya to rejoin.

Mordecai: (Talking over McIntyre's voice) Hello? Hello?

McIntyre: If you come back to us today, you'll get free romantic coupons. To rejoin, say "yee-haw!" To cancel, say "adios".

Mordecai: Adios! Adios!

(Mordecai hangs up, and the screen pans over to show McIntyre standing behind him)

Mordecai: Aah!

McIntyre: Told ya I wasn't a recording! What do ya mean "adios", pardner?

Mordecai: Uh, I don't need Couple Corral anymore. I'm in a relationship now, so...

McIntyre: Here's what I'm thinkin'. Break up with CJ.

Mordecai: (Angrily) Excuse me?

McIntyre: Break up with her and rejoin my site! (Wraps an arm around Mordecai) Couple Corral could help you find somebody better.

Mordecai: Dude, I'm happy with CJ.

McIntyre: Will you be though after we dredge through her profile? (Takes out his phone) Okay, let's see what we dig up here.

(McIntyre shows Mordecai photos of CJ with different hairstyles.)

Mordecai: Isn't keeping her information, like, really illegal?

McIntyre: You'd think. (He stops on a photo of goth CJ) Whoa! How do you expect her to be committed to you when this girl can't even commit to a hairstyle?

Mordecai: (Shoves McIntyre away) So? I like CJ. Now leave me alone.

(Mordecai walks away, and McIntyre glares at him menacingly. Cut to Mordecai and CJ's table. CJ is on the phone.)

CJ: Hi, L'Wafflerie? I just wanted to check and see if the waffle cake I ordered is ready.

(CJ gasps and quickly puts her phone away when Mordecai returns)

Mordecai: Unbelievable! CJ, when you deleted your Couple Corral profile, did its CEO come to you in person and tell you to break up with me?

CJ: (Confused) No.

Mordecai: Ugh. Let's just enjoy dinner.

(Transition to after dinner. Mordecai and CJ have clean dinner plates in front of them.)

Mordecai: Man, that steak was off the hook!

CJ: Yeah, this was so good.

Mordecai: Ready for dessert? (Snaps his fingers) Garcon!

(A waiter walks over with Mordecai's gift box hidden under a serving dish. CJ's phone vibrates with an incoming call from L'Wafflerie.)

CJ: You know what? Let's skip dessert.

Mordecai: What?

CJ: Uh, I... (She stands up) ...gotta go to the bathroom. Excuse me.

(CJ walks away, passing the waiter Mordecai called over. The waiter looks confusedly at Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Uh...

(A car's high beams shine through the window and its horn plays "La Cucaracha". Mordecai looks out the window and sees McIntyre.)

McIntyre: Hey, Mordecai! Wanna meet a girl that doesn't have to go to the bathroom? Call me!

(Mordecai looks angry. Circle-wipe to later on; Mordecai and CJ are leaving the restaurant.)

Mordecai: Hey, I'll catch up. Gotta tie my shoe real quick.

CJ: I can wait.

Mordecai: No! Uh... it's better if I have privacy.

CJ: (Confused) Uh... okay.

(CJ walks off-screen as Mordecai bends down to "tie his shoe". With CJ out of earshot, Mordecai takes out his phone and calls Rigby.)

Rigby: Talk to Rig.

Mordecai: Dude, the dessert plan failed.

Rigby: Whaaaat?

Mordecai: I need you to pick up the bracelet at the restaurant and bring it to the Koffee Kiosk in the square.

Rigby: I'm on it.

(Mordecai catches up with CJ)

Mordecai: Sorry about that. I just wanted to try out this new knot.

CJ: Okay.

(She chuckles)

Mordecai: Do you mind actually if we cut over to Main Street?

CJ: Well... (Stuttering)

(The screen cuts to a shot behind CJ. L'Wafflerie is across the street.)

CJ: It's just that... Well, I was kinda hoping we could stay on this block.

Mordecai: Really? But Main Street's so much more romantic.

CJ: Um, hello? Dry cleaners, notary publics as far as the eye can see? This is where it's at.

Mordecai and CJ: (Laughing)

(Mordecai sighs and puts an arm around CJ. They walk forward a few feet, then Mordecai breaks into a run down the block.)

Mordecai: Race you to the square!

CJ: Huh? No!

(CJ takes out her phone and calls Eileen)

Eileen: Hey, what's up?

CJ: Waffle plan's been jacked. I need backup.

Eileen: Copy that. What do I do?

CJ: I need you to pick up the waffle cake and meet me by the big fountain in town square.

Eileen: I'm on it.

(They both hang up. Cut to Mordecai running down the street. CJ quickly catches up with him...)

CJ: You're pretty fast, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Huh?

(...and pulls into the lead.)

CJ: Not fast enough!

(Their race ends in front of the town square water fountain)

CJ: Woo-hoo! I win!

Mordecai: (Out of breath) That's not fair. You exercise. Let me just get a cup of coffee. Then I bet I can outrun you.

CJ: (She elbows Mordecai) Face it, dude. You lost. Come on. (She takes Mordecai by the hand) Let's go make a wish in the fountain. You can wish to be faster at running.

(Rigby stands by the Koffee Kiosk with the bracelet.)

Rigby: Dude!

(Mordecai waves to Rigby, and Rigby starts walking over. Mordecai takes out a coin.)

Mordecai: Okay, here I go. (closes his eyes) I wish... for a cute girlfriend who likes me back.

(Mordecai and CJ laugh as he flips the coin. The screen follows the coin as it travels up into the air and stops on McIntyre's blimp.)

McIntyre: Dump Cloudy Jay!

(Mordecai is in shock as the coin splashes into the fountain.)

CJ: Is he watching us?

Mordecai: Let's get out of here.

(Rigby walks up to the fountain, and Mordecai and CJ are gone)

Rigby: Argh! Come on, dude! Stick to the plan!

Eileen: Rigby?

(Eileen appears behind Rigby with the waffle cake)

Rigby: Eileen? What are you doing here? Are you gonna eat that by yourself?

Eileen: (Shaking her head) I'm doing a favor for CJ. Did you... buy jewelry?

Rigby: Ugh. No. I'm doing a favor for Mordecai.

Eileen: Wait...

(Eileen narrows her eyes, then Rigby narrows his eyes. Cut to Mordecai and CJ by the Koffee Kiosk.)

Mordecai: I think we're safe. You want a coffee?

CJ: I'm good. You?

Mordecai: Nah.

(A brief pause, then Mordecai and CJ talk over each other)

Mordecai: I think I left something at the fountain.

CJ: Uh, I'm gonna use the bathroom.

(They walk to opposite ends of the kiosk and take out their phones to call Rigby and Eileen.)

Mordecai: Rigby!

CJ: Eileen!

Rigby and Eileen: New plan.

Rigby: Come to the pier by the waterfront.

Eileen: You can get your present there.

Rigby and Eileen: Over and out.

(Mordecai and CJ hang up and walk back over to each other)

Mordecai and CJ: Let's go to the waterfront.

(Scene transitions to the waterfront amusement park)

Mordecai: Well, here we are at the waterfront.

CJ: Yup. All sorts of surprising, romantic stuff happens here.

(Mordecai and CJ stop and gasp, looking at a candlelit table setting with their gifts on the table)

Mordecai and CJ: Whoa.

(As they run over to the table, Rigby and Eileen are seen hiding inside a crate)

Mordecai and CJ: For me? So that's why you were acting all... And that's why you made all those...

Mordecai: Excuses.

(Mordecai and CJ begin to laugh)

CJ: Tying your shoe?

Mordecai: Going to the bathroom. I was calling Rigby.

CJ: I was calling Eileen!

(As Mordecai and CJ laugh together, Rigby and Eileen watch and bump fists)

Mordecai: I'm sorry this wasn't more romantic.

CJ: This is the most romantic date I've ever been on.

Mordecai: (He goes wide-eyed) Really?

(CJ goes wide-eyed as well and nods her head. She and Mordecai move in for a kiss, but they're interrupted when the pier shakes.)

Mordecai: Something hit the pier!

(They run up to the edge of the pier, and McIntyre's submarine rises out of the water. The hatch opens and McIntyre comes out.)

McIntyre: Last chance, Mordecai! Break up with her!

Mordecai: Dude, what's your deal?! Aren't we the point of your site? Shouldn't you want us to stay together?

McIntyre: (He sighs and shakes his head) Whoever here knows how to run a website, raise their hand. (He raises his hand) Happy couples don't use Couple Corral; lonely people do! Lonely people lead to subscribers. Subscribers lead to more clicks. More clicks somehow lead to millions of dollars. Millions of dollars lead to sweet corporate-branded stuff. See?! (He gestures to his blimp and begins to sob) My site's too good! There's nobody left! Happy couples have been leavin' in droves! I'm bankrupt!

CJ: Dude, just sell your stuff!

McIntyre: No! My crooked lawyer told me this is the only way! Break up with her!

Mordecai: No way! We're really into each other!

McIntyre: If you won't break up with her... (Takes out a bazooka) ...I'll do it for ya. Let me introduce you to the Couple Corral "Breakup-ulator".

(Mordecai and CJ scream in terror as McIntyre takes aim at CJ. He fires a missile with "It's not you, it's me." written on its side.)

Mordecai: Look out!

(Mordecai pushes CJ out of the way of the missile, and it explodes into the pier. CJ falls back, and Mordecai's body rolls onto the beach. He lies lifeless with CJ's gift in his hand with bruises and scrapes on him along with his hair and suit cut up a little and messed up.)

CJ: Mordecai!

(She glares angrily at McIntyre)

McIntyre: Well, darn. That didn't work out like I wanted it to. CJ! Rejoin my site?

(CJ's eyes turn red, and she begins breathing heavily)

McIntyre: Uh-oh.

CJ: NO!!!

(CJ turns into a giant gray storm cloud, leaving her clothes behind. The water around McIntyre becomes turbulent.)

CJ: LEAVE... US... ALONE!!!

(Lightning strikes the pier under McIntyre's car, and it falls onto a gas tank and explodes. The car's bull horn-shaped hood ornament flies up into McIntyre's blimp, rupturing it. The blimp plummets down toward McIntyre's submarine.)

McIntyre: Hubris!

(An explosion destroys the blimp and submarine and kills McIntyre. Transition to CJ, back to normal, crying over Mordecai's body with his head on her lap.)

CJ: (Sobbing) Mordecai... Mordecai... Mordecai... No!!!

(As CJ holds Mordecai, her tears splash onto his face and CJ hugged his head. Then Mordecai began to cough and groan)

CJ: (Gasp) Mordecai?! (they hugged each other) I thought you were dead!

Mordecai: (He sits upright) I would be... if not for this gift box. I hope you like it.

(Mordecai opens the box. The charm bracelet now only has a single charm on it shaped like a heart.)

(CJ gasps slowly)

Mordecai: There's a different charm for- (Looks at the new bracelet) Whoa! Well, there used to be different charms. I guess they must've all gotten welded into a heart by the bazooka blast.

(CJ puts the bracelet on her left wrist)

CJ: I love it.

Mordecai: I thought that you would.

CJ: I guess the thing I had for you must've exploded.

Mordecai: That's okay. I got my wish.

CJ: What, that you can run faster than me?

Mordecai: No, for a cute girlfriend that likes-

(CJ cuts him off with a kiss as the sun rises in the background. Cut to Rigby and Eileen. Eileen is holding the waffle cake and gives it to Rigby, who's holding a fork.)

Rigby: (Gasp) Is this waffles and a cake and chocolate?

Eileen: Yeah.

(Rigby takes a bite of the cake)

Rigby: I love it.

Eileen: I thought that you would.

Rigby: Okay. Whoever makes this jump gets to choose lunch.

Eileen: You're on!

(Rigby, who is Player 1, makes the perfect jump while Eileen fails.)

Rigby: Ohhhhh! We're going to Wing Kingdom!

(Eileen sighs. The two go back to playing as Benson comes into the living room.)

Benson: Rigby, did you clean out the gutters yet?

Rigby: No way. That's a two-man job.

Benson: Well, where's Mordecai?

Rigby: I dunno. I haven't seen him.

Eileen: Come to think of it, I haven't seen him since CJ dumped him at Muscle Man's wedding.

Benson: Yeah, no one has. He hasn't come to work for two weeks now. I tried calling, but he won't pick up.

Rigby: What? No, here. I'll call him.

(Without looking, he grabs his phone from inside the couch and speed dials Mordecai's number. He holds his phone to his ear. A vibration is heard, and Rigby hears it in the couch.)

(He opened Mordecai's phone and saw 300+ missed calls from Benson)

Rigby: Huh, that's not like Mordecai.

Benson: (frustrated) I can't believe this! You don't even know where your best friend is!?

Rigby: Hey, I've been busy. (signs which means hanging out with Eileen)

Benson: Look, I just concerned about the well-being about my employees as any park manager, but I've got a business to run in.(continues speaking)If you don't find Mordecai and bring him back to work by tomorrow, then I'm gonna have to fire him.

Rigby: (shocked) WHAT?! (stands up on the couch) WAIT! I can find him.

Benson: Well for your sake I hope so, otherwise you'll be cleaning the gutters solo from now on.

(Scene cuts to Mordecai and Rigby's bedroom, Rigby digs out a pile of clothes from the whole room until the whole room is filled with dirty clothes to find Mordecai)

Rigby: (digging out socks from the drawer, speaking to himself) Come on Mordecai, give me a clue here.

(His phone rings, he took out his phone and answered the call)

Rigby: Hello?

Eileen: Hey, I checked from Margaret, she hasn't seen or heard from Mordecai.

Rigby: Yeah, his parents don't know where he is either.

Eileen: And I don't think he'll be hanging out with CJ anytime soon. Well, (she takes out a flyer of Mordecai labeled 'Missing" on the top) I'll start putting these flyers around town.Hopefully a hundred should be enough.

Rigby: Well I'll be privileging his personal stuff he doesn't like me touching, see ya.(hangs up)

(Rigby takes the mattress off and sees the note, he picks up and reads it.)

Rigby: "Dear Mordecai, stop wallowing in your lady woes and come have sodas..."

Sad Sax: (narrating the letter) "...With other single bros! There's a place with hot sandy beaches and an All You Can Eat buffet. So pick up your sax and jam with the crew in Dumptown U.S.A.! Signed, Sad Sax."

Rigby: (annoyed) Uh, Sad Sax Guy, I should have known! At Dumptown U.S.A.? That sounds so lame! I bet nobody's ever been to this place.

Benson: Woo Hoo, Audrey who?!?! (flashbacks ends) Yep, good times. So good, that some people don’t ever leave, and I don’t blame them.

Eileen: You know what?! It's OVER!! GET OUT!! Consider yourself dumped loser!! (Kicks Rigby out) Don't call me!(Slams door)

Rigby: (Weakly) D-did I just get dumped for reals?

(The Sad Sax theme plays while the camera zooms up to show Sad Sax laying on the roof)

Sad Sax: (Scoffs) Chicks man.

Rigby: How long have you been up there?

Sad Sax: Brother, I saw the whole thing.

Rigby: IT WASN'T FOR REALS!!!

Sad Sax: That's what they all say.

Mr. Maellard: And that's what I call liquid assets!

(the female guest laughs)

Male Guest: Maellard, oh boy! Your brunch is the event of the season!

Mr. Maellard: Eh, it's okay. But no brunch would be complete without a little dessert! (he taps his cup with his cane) The most expensive sheet cake in the world!

(a giant sheet cake is being brought in by some guards, it has "$1,000,000" written on it)

Mr. Maellard: If you want to know how much it costs, take a look at the frosting.

(Everybody laughs as Maellard smiles, when suddenly, Rigby comes through the bushes, sleeping on a lawnmower)

Benson: (turning red) RIGBY!!

(Rigby ends up wrecking the cake, getting it splattered all over everybody)

Mr. Maellard: Aarrggh!!!

(Cut to Benson's office)

Rigby: What? I'll buy you a new cake!

Benson: (red and angry) YOU REALLY SCREWED UP THIS TIME!!

Mr. Maellard: Hold on now, Benson! You share as much to blame as he does! You are his manager.

Rigby: It's true, Benson! I told you I needed a nap.

Benson: You were tired because you were up all night PLAYING VIDEO GAMES!

Mr. Maellard: ENOUGH! Rigby's a screwup but discipline starts at the top. So here's what's gonna happen. (he opens a drawer, gets out some paper and a pen) One of you is going to write a letter of resignation by 5 o'clock. Nobody leaves this office until it's done, and if you can't work it out. YOU'RE BOTH FIRED! (he leaves and slams the door)

Benson: This is the last thing I need today! First, my car breaks down and I have to get a ride from my dad. And, now this. All right, Rigby, stop playing around and write that letter.

Rigby: (in the manager's chair) Why should I write it? Didn't you hear? Maellard said it was your fault. 'Cause you mismanaged me!

Benson: Come on, Rigby! We both know this is your fault.

(Rigby reads a book on the desk)

Rigby: Not now, Benson. I'm reading up on my management techniques, there's some really good stuff in here.

(Benson snatches the book away from Rigby)

Rigby: Hey, I was reading that!

(Rigby tries to take the book back)

Benson: Why can't you take anything seriously?

Rigby: Why are you so uptight?!

(The book splits in half as the two fight for it, just before Maellard barges in)

Mr. Maellard: What's going on in here?

(Benson and Rigby mumble. Maellard spots the torn book and takes it away)

Mr. Maellard: Give me that! This isn't "party" time, this is "write a letter to quit" time. And if I have to come back in here, I'm busting heads!

(Maellard storms out)

Rigby: I'm not writing that letter.

(A clock is shown as time flies to 1 o'clock. Rigby sneaks out of the office)

Benson: Rigby, don't you make me come out there! Ugh!

(Benson chases Rigby, who packed a bag on his bed)

Benson: Rigby! If Mr. Maellard catches us out of the room, we're dead!

Rigby: Well then go back so that you won't get caught!

Benson: That's it, Rigby, you march right back- -! (he hears someone coming) Oh, shoot! (hides under the bed)

Mordecai: (comes in with Skips) Rigby, what are you doing here?

Rigby: You can come out now, Benson.

(Benson crawls out of the bed)

Mordecai: Oh hey, Benson.

Benson: Mmm.

Mordecai: I thought Maellard was gonna fire you.

Rigby: (scoffs) Maellard's just bluffing.

(They hear footsteps from the hallway)

Pops: (offscreen) But Papa! You can't fire both of them!

Rigby: Aah!

Benson: Shh! (whispers) We gotta get outta here!

(Benson and Rigby climb out of the window and onto the roof of the house.)

Rigby: Which way is your office?

Benson: Uh... down there!

(They start going around the roof to Benson's office, but Rigby stops Benson when he saw Maellard looking out the window)

Mr. Maellard: (groans) So angry at those two! I think I'll just stare at my beloved park for a few long minutes.

(Rigby and Benson crawl under the window so that Maellard wouldn't see them)

Mr. Maellard: Nah, on second thought, I better check in on them

(On that note, Rigby and Benson quietly gasp in shock before they quickly ran off until they found the window for Benson's office)

Rigby: Oh yeah-yuh!

(Rigby opens the window and goes in the office, but when Benson tried to get in, he slipped on a loose tile and clung onto the window)

Benson: Aah! Rigby, give me a hand!

(Rigby hears the door being knocked on by Mr. Maellard and runs towards it)

Benson: Rigby!

(The door slowly begins to open, only for Rigby to push the door shut and lock it)

Mr. Maellard: What the- -?!

(Rigby grabs Benson's hand and helps pull him up into the office, before hearing Maellard banging on the door again. Rigby opens the door.)

Mr. Maellard: Rigby! What's the meaning of this?!

Rigby: Uh, the door was stuck. I was trying to help. You know, old house.

Mr. Maellard: (suspiciously) Benson?

Benson: (hesitates a little; nervously) Uh... yeah, it does that sometimes. The door... sticks.

(Mr. Maellard looks on suspiciously and closes the door)

Benson: (exhilaratingly) What am I feeling right now? What is this called?!

Rigby: It's called being alive.

Benson: Oh. Well... thanks for helping me.

Rigby: No problem.

(A clock wipe transition to the office. The time is now 2:00. Rigby plays his game on the couch while Benson sits on his desk with his hands on his head in despair)

Benson: Ohhhh, what am I gonna do? This job is my life! Okay, tell you what; if you write this letter, I'll write you a stellar letter of recommendation for your next job.

Rigby: Yeah, Benson, I'll think about it. But I can't think on an empty stomach. (pulls out a box of wings from Wing Kingdom)

Benson: You're not gonna eat those wings cold, are you?

Rigby: Geez, Benson, you're even uptight about how to eat hot wings! (takes a bite of a wing) You'll do a lot better at your next job if you loosen up a bit.

(Benson turns mad, runs toward Rigby and takes the box of wings)

Benson: Gimme that.

Rigby: Hey!

(Benson opens part of his office's floor, which leads to the ceiling ducts, and gets in. Rigby follows him)

Rigby: Benson, wait!

(Cut to Benson and Rigby climbing into the ducts)

Rigby: Where are we going?

Benson: The kitchen, Rigby. We're gonna cook these wings.

Rigby: But I'm fine with eating them cold.

Benson: We're better than that.

Rigby: I'm not!

(They look at the floor of the kitchen from the air vent)

Benson: Looks like the coast is clear.

(Benson opens the kitchen vent and he falls out and lands on his feet, striking a pose. Rigby, however, lands on his stomach)

Rigby: We're just gonna reheat 'em and go, right?

Benson: Yeah.

Rigby: (runs to the door) I'll look out for Maellard.

(Benson opens the kitchen cabinet)

Benson: Now where's the paprika?

Rigby: Are you-- Paprika? Are you kidding?!

(Cut to Benson, already gotten out the things needed to make his own style of the wings, with his apron on. He puts the wings in a bowl)

Rigby: I thought we were just gonna reheat 'em and go.

Benson: Uh, that's what I'm doing... (Looks at Rigby) ...the Benson way. (Winks)

(Rigby slowly turns to the door while Benson imitates an electric guitar riff)

Benson: (singing) Microwave wings, microwave wings. This is Benson's recipe for microwave wings. Dash of pepper, blast of curry, mixing 'em slow-woah, not gonna hurry.

Rigby: What are you singing?

Benson: "Microwave Wings", off of Cournitopia, Heir To The Throne's recipe concept album. It was a huge hit on the Adult Contemporary Prod Rock Soft Metal charts.

Rigby: Never heard of it.

Benson: (singing) Microwave wings, Microwave wings. Where did everybody go after the show? (Puts wings in the box) Benson's on his own again, don't ya know? Benson eats alone. (Puts box in the microwave and sets the timer for 90 seconds) Benson eats alone. (talking) Man, good tune. Weird bridge though.

(Rigby watches Pops and Mr. Maellard running)

Rigby: (gasps) They're coming!

Benson: But the song said it's gotta cook for 90 seconds, and not one second less!

Rigby: I'm bailing! (runs) Get outta my way!

Margaret: Here's your coffee sir.

Producer of Local News: Ah thanks Margarita.

Jackie: Margarita bring me coffee while you're there? Please and thank you.

Margaret: Yes , of course.

(Sale to brew coffee)

Local News producer: Well, I think you know that each and every one of you are an important part of this team.

Producer of Local News: So this announcement is for all present, Channel 6 is looking for a fresh news segment, which has the "Wow" factor, something that we yell "Weekly".

(Shown to Margarita listening while preparing coffee)

Producer of Local News: As I said the hearing is open to all, only deliver their videos in the next three days and the person you choose, will have its own weekly segment.

(All rise and leave, except for Frank, Jackie and Margarita)

(Margarita comes to where Frank and Jackie were)

Margarita: Here's your Late.

Jackie: O-oy! You saved my life.

Jackie: Well Frank, the helicopter was fun, but it's time that Jackie shine, I will go after the weekly news segment, because it is clear that I deserve, assuming that I never missed a day of work, not to mention the prize " traffic "to win.

Frank: Well, I think Margaret could get if he tried.

Margarita: What? No, I have not even been here so long, although it would be amazing ... but I think that even I'm not ready ...

Frank: Do you think he was ready the first time I got to the helicopter in June? Not even have pilot 's license, or my contact lenses, but flew anyway, You should never stop pursuing your dreams, love! (Says pointing)

Margaret: Well, actually that segment I like what is the risk to try?

Frank: That's my girl! (Laughs Margarita happy at the same time)

Margaret: But you have your license? true?

Frank: Let 's go home.

Jackie: They could be many risks to try! , Frank! Frank! (He said while they were going)

(Eileen House)

Margarita: Okay ... they are looking for something that has the "wow" factor (Margarita turns and writes the word "Wow" on a canvas)

Margarita: Guys! ¿¡Have any ideas that are "Wow" !?

Eileen: Maybe something cerebral, like a piece of thought, maybe something like Ahh ... (thinks for a few seconds) You know ...

Margarita: Okay ... (turns again and type the word "Think", ie "Think" in English) What else, makes them see the news?

Rigby: The persecutions!

Mordecai: Yes ... and when the police do "out of the car, garbage" Chiu Chiu, fipichiu (imitating the sound of bullets).

Margarita : Yes! Trash! That's! I will go on deck to catch the garbage from the city.

(Channel 6)

(Office Channel 6)

Frank: Reporter on deck?

Margaret: As costumes and hidden cameras, I want my segment helps people you know ...? , The call "Margaret always ... Margatrapa to bad"

Frank: I do not love the name, but I love seeing the fire in you angel.

(Jackie comes walking to where Margaret and Frank are)

Jackie: Hey Frank, I heard that death rates for reporters covered is very high, you sure you want to send your "little angel" to that danger?

Frank: It may be a little dangerous, but relied heavily on Margarita. You know the station has an anonymous tip line, I'm sure they will help you with your stories.

(If you have a better translation for this dialogue was censored in Latin America, please place)

Del: Yes, that direct line gave me good information. On those steroids in the field of curling. It has the seal of approval of the.

From: Oh, Del, you did it again.

(At night)

(Margaret was lying on the desk)

Daisy: Come on ...! It sounds! ( He takes out his phone, has a message for Mordecai, who says "Any tips yet?" To which Margarita reads "Any information?" And then responds with a smiley, ":(" to which Mordecai responds with another, "/", to which Margarita responds again with another, "-_-", to which Mordecai replies with a drawing made with the characters) Wow (said aloud to see the drawing)!

(The desk phone starts ringing)

Margarete: ?! Ho-wave !?

???: I have a clue for you, see you in the parking lot of the corner of Elvi Hiland.

Margarita: I'll be there ...

(Later, in the parking lot)

(Margarita turns, and sees a snarling cat, to which Margarita a little scared walking back some hissing, until it rests on the wall)

(Suddenly the mysterious subject appears)

Margaret: Oh, you ...

???: Have you heard of "cheeses" (Cheezer's)

Margaret: Oh yeah ...

???: This is a corporate e above. (Dice showing it ), you ever heard of vegetarian sandwich that had beef?

Margarita: What?

???: Cheese has been compromised ... (Goes down the alley)

(Margarita observes mail)

Narrator: "quesitos uses meat"

(Margarita nods).

(Cheezers)

Employee: Who 's next in line?

Margarita (disguised as an old woman) : Oh ... Hey boy, I hope to give discounts to the elderly here, as you see, I am one.

Employee: That's mistress.

Margarita (disguised as an old woman) : I can not wait to eat a vegetarian sandwich, Hey have not begun to put meat on those do you?

Employee: Ah, no ma'am.

Margarita: It 's funny because it says otherwise. Margarita Marga ... always catches the bad.

Employee: Do you want to add jalapenos to be a full meal?

Margarita: What ...? Do not! This is the news ... ... Gotcha! Catch you...!

Employee: Hey let me see that. Ah lady should check your sources, this is a very old, Go campaign ... ( holds up a poster ad, which reads "meatless products using high - quality cheeses"), can not believe I fell into that ... Hahaha.

Other employees: Ha ha ha ha.

Employee: Next.

(Office, at night)

Margarita: Aay, that was so humiliating, have to go to quesitos this across town now ...

(The phone rings on the desktop)

Margarita: Hello?

???: It's me.

Daisy: You, better be good, your last call was a hoax, quesitos is clean.

???: That's what they want to believe. Anyway forget quesitos, I have something better, tomorrow at 10, you know where to find me .

(Parking lot)

Margarita: Hello! Where are you..!?

Narrator: Garbage. (Reading the word "Trash Only")

???: Over here.

Margarita: In this dump?

???: No, the other dump. (Exit from the dump)

???: Oh, have you heard of ... gambling?

Margarita: Yes.

???: As they say in the streets the manager of the local park, using tax money to make bets within the park.

Margarita: Okay, this definitely wrong, I know them , and there is no way they are making bets, and not trust you.

???: Maybe you trust this (He shows a photo of Skips on a betting table) (Margarita observes)

???: Keep money ...

(The mysterious man closes the lid of the dump)

(Park)

Narrator: Park ...

Benson: Yes, it is the best punter in the city.

(Margarita watches while wearing a costume with a suit and a fake mustache)

Skips: Well, how much money you cost?

Benson: A couple hundred but I got something good, sees this and cries (pulls out a wad of bills)

Skips: O jo jo jo, and can count cards?

Benson: A Fu, beats a ladder?

Skips / Benson: Ha ha ha ha.

Margarita: Do not move cheaters! (Fake mustache and hat is removed)

Skips / Benson: Eh ...

Margarita: Margaret always Mar-gets the bad guy.

Benson: Margaret?

Skips: Is that some kind of bad slogan I do not know?

Margarita: I did not want to believe this, but you are doing illegal gambling with tax money.

Benson: This money is a refund to buy the Gambler our new mower.

Margaret: But you were talking about cards.

Benson: Card! , ID cards! (Pass the letter pruner)

Pruner: One ...

Benson: Without keys!

Margaret: Well ... not be able to clear this up (takes a picture Skips betting) Explain this photo!

Skips: Ah, that's Night casino community, why we stop doing that?

Margaret: Well ... are not gamblers, I'm wrong again ...

(Cafeteria)

Mordecai: We could have said that the park does not run bets.

Margarita: I know, I just wanted both the segment that convinced me to believe this information What do I do now?

Eileen: Maybe you can make a simple as a cooking show segment, you prepare a big cake.

Daisy: He said he wanted the "Wow" factor is not the factor "Mm" you know? (pulls out his phone to this sonar) This is weird never had written me before.

Narrator: (reading ".. Got another tip for you THE BIGGEST ONE YET URGENT !!!") I have another report, the bigger this now. Urgent...

(Parking lot)

???: I'm glad you came, this time I have a very good coffee have you heard?

Margarita: Oh, yes, I heard the coffee.

???: Well maybe you've heard of this cafe are not serving real coffee, just fly lies.

Margarita: Wow! Is that your information?

???: Wait, if you walk in and order a Late I'm sure you'll find ...

Margarita: A Late? Work there before and no orders that ... What's your game?

???: Hey, if you do not want my information, okay, I have other people to inform, I'm just a common and anonymous informant (drops the device that distorts the audio)

Margarita: Wait! Say that again!

Jackie: Oh, No, I can not, Goodbye. (Margarita removes his hat, and reveals that the subject "anonymous" is Jackie)

Margaret: Ah, Jackie Carmichael!

Jackie: You think I'll let you come and take this weekly segment right under my nose? Win a prize once! I'm not going to lose to the young daughter of Frank!

Margarita: I knew there was something very strange to you, so record everything with a hidden camera (his handkerchief and the sample is removed)

Jackie: Ahh!

Margaret: When you upload these images to the hard drive of the season was over all for you. ( He whistles to call the truck channel 6, which comes quickly)

Margarita: Accelerate! (He says while climbing on the back of the truck)

Jackie: You'd teach who takes Lates!

Margarita: I did not know, really not.

Announcer: Blood. (Shows a zombie biting someone's arm, with blood coming out) Guts. (Shows a zombie taking a guy's guts out of his body. The guy screams.) Dinner. (Shows a policeman in a chair. A bunch of arms holding forks and knives bust through the wall. The policeman screams) Zombie Dinner Party.

Mordecai: That looks awesome.

Rigby: I'm glad you said that, because I got us... BAM!!! (throws 2 tickets on the table) 2 tickets for opening night!

Mordecai: Ooh, I kind of already got 2 tickets for Pajama Sisters 2.

Rigby: What? Why? That's just some chick flick. And not even the good kind! I saw the preview. They're just gonna sit around talking about their feelings, fully clothed.

Mordecai: No, dude. I got these tickets for me and Margaret. I'm finally gonna try and ask her out.

Rigby: Aw, what? But it's opening night! Do you know how hard it was to get these tickets?

Margaret: Hey, guys, your food is almost ready. Sorry for the hold-up.

Mordecai: Oh, hey, Margaret. Um, I was wondering, uh, would you, uh, like to, uh, you know, uh...

Rigby: You're gonna have to excuse Mordecai here. He has a hard time trying to "espresso" himself.

Margaret: (laughs) Good one, Rigby. I'll be right back with your food, guys.

Rigby: Dude, did you see how hard Margaret laughed at me?

Mordecai: That wasn't funny.

Rigby: Yes it was. Man, what's your problem?

Margaret: Here you go, guys. (puts two salads down on the table)

Rigby: Salad? Where's my French dip?

Margaret: Huh? Oh, I'm sorry. I messed up, let me take it back.

Rigby: Everything okay, Margaret? You seem like you've got a "full plate".

Margaret: (laughs) Yeah! I'm just a little stressed 'cause I'm moving out of my place today.

Mordecai: I can help you.

Margaret: Really? Thanks, Mordecai!

Rigby: Hey, Margaret, I can help you move too.

Margaret: Oh, perfect! Do you guys mind coming by my place in an hour?

Rigby: Oh, we don't mind. It'll be a "moving" experience for all of us.

Margaret: (laughs) Rigby!

(Mordecai kicks Rigby under the table)

Rigby: Ow! What?

Mordecai: Nothing.

Rigby: Wait a minute... you're jealous.

Mordecai: What? No I'm not.

Rigby: Dude, you're just jealous 'cause I made her laugh and all you do is sit like this: Uh, uh, uh...

Mordecai: Whatever. Just stay out of my way when I'm helping her move.

(Scene changes to outside Margaret's apartment, where Mordecai and Rigby are helping her put boxes into a truck)

Margaret: Alright, guys, we're almost done.

(Mordecai puts a box into the truck)

Mordecai: Do it. Just do it. Hey, Margaret. Um, I've been meaning to ask you, uh, do you want to, uh, have me pick up that box?

Margaret: Oh, yeah, thanks! This is the last one, but be careful because it's really...(sees Mordecai trying to pick it up)...heavy. Uh, do you need help with that?

Mordecai: It's cool. I got it. (carries the box over to the truck)

Rigby: (standing in a box) Hey, Margaret. Briefs or (pulls the box up) boxers?

Margaret: (laughs) You're so funny, Rigby. Okay, gotta go talk to the manager. I'll be right back. (walks away)

Mordecai: Hey, Rigby. You better leave, dude. You're ruining my chances with Margaret.

Rigby: What? You haven't even made a move on her yet. You're gonna end up seeing Zombie Dinner Party with me anyway.

Mordecai: No, I'm not. Quit screwing this up for me.

Rigby: You're just jealous that I can talk to chicks, and you can't!

(They see Margaret walking back towards them)

Rigby: You gonna ask her out or what?

Margaret: Hey, guys. Ready to call it a day?

Mordecai: Margaret! Uh, just wanted to ask you if you want to, uh, I mean you obviously don't have to but, uh...

Rigby: Margaret, wanna see something cool? BAM! (shows tickets) Two tickets for the Zombie Dinner Party premiere! Wanna go with me tonight?

Margaret: You actually got tickets? Yeah, I'll totally go with you tonight! Mordecai, you gotta come too!

Rigby: Mordecai can't come because I only got two tickets!

Margaret: Aw, maybe next time?

Mordecai: No. No, it's cool. You guys have a good time.

Margaret: Okay. I'll see you at 8, Rigby! (gets into the truck)

Mordecai: Alright, dude, I'll go to the movie with you. Just call it off with her.

Rigby: Pfft, yeah, right. I'm not going with you. You had your chance, and you blew it! You blew it!

Mordecai: Agh! Come on, dude, just give me another chance.

Rigby: Ok, I give you another chance, if you admit that you're jealous.

Mordecai: No, I'm not jealous.

Rigby: Then I guess I'm still going out with Margaret. Ohhhhhhhhh! You blew it again, you blew it again!

(Goes to next scene where Rigby is on the computer at the park)

Rigby: Mordecai, check this out.

Mordecai: What?

(Shows Mordecai the trailer for "Pajama Sisters 2")

Girl in trailer: Haha, ahh. Why doesn't he like me? (sobs)

(Comments on the computer saying that the movie sucks)

Rigby: Looks like Pajama Sisters 2 is bombing, but it's doing better than you did with Margaret. Ohhhhhh! 3 more hours till my date! (Next scene at the kitchen, with Rigby talking to Muscle Man) Hey, Muscle Man, do you know what I like best about Margaret? The way she's not going out with this guy!

Muscle Man: Ohhhh!

Rigby: Ohhhhhh! 2 more hours till my date.

Muscle Man & Rigby: Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

(Next scene in the living room, where Mordecai and Rigby are playing a video game)

Rigby: Aw, man! This is just like earlier! (Imitating Margaret) Mordecai, help! These boxes are too heavy! (Normal voice) Mordecai can't help you, Margaret, he's too busy not asking you out! (He wins the game and the female video game character comes out) Oh, yeah, Margaret. (The game characters are now tongue kissing, and he mocks the tongue kiss to Mordecai, who looks jealous) Ohhhhhhhhhh! Only one more hour till my date. And that's exactly how it's gonna go down. (It is now the night time, and Mordecai is still in the living room with the T.V static on. Rigby comes out, getting ready for his "date" with Margaret. He is wearing a black tie and is combing his hair back) Hey, Pajama Sister, what are you doing? Watching T.V. all by yourself? Well, that doesn't surprise me, since you can't talk to chicks.

Mordecai: I'm warning you man. You better call her and cancel.

Rigby: I can't cancel, that's being rude. I can't be rude to the ladies. Besides I've got... (looks at his watch) twenty minutes till my date.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Are you sure it's only twenty minutes till your date?

Rigby: Huh? (looks at watch again, and sees that there is no battery inside) What did you do with my battery?

Mordecai: It could be twenty minutes till your date. Or maybe it's half an hour, or maybe you already missed it!

Rigby: Whatever! I'll find out what time it is!

(Rigby runs to find a clock that reveals what the real time is, Mordecai gives chase. The first clock is on top of a shelf, which Mordecai takes with ease. The second is Pops' cuckoo clock and drives on with Mordecai taking every other clock in the house. The last clock Rigby tries to check is the microwave, which Mordecai blocks with his hand)

Mordecai: Call it off with her.

Rigby: You're jealous, Mordecai! It's all over your face!

Mordecai: My face isn't jealous! (Puts all the clocks in the microwave)

Rigby: Dude, what are you doing? You can't do that!

Mordecai: Can't do what? This? (Shuts microwave door, turns on the microwave, and the clocks melt) Now you'll never be on time for your date.

Rigby: (jumping on Mordecai) Gimme back those clocks!

Mordecai: No!!

(They fight, but then Mordecai accidentally gets tackled to the microwave, which teleports them away through a powerful electrical surge. They both scream as they move in top speed.)

Rigby: What's your problem?! Why do you have to be jealous all the time?!

Mordecai: Shut up! This is all your fault! I finally get a chance to ask out Margaret, but you had to butt in and ruin everything!

Rigby: No, I didn't! I just wanted to see Zombie Dinner Party with my bro, who flaked on me, for some girl who doesn't even know he exists! (pushes Mordecai)

Mordecai: I'LL KILL YOU!!! (Mordecai then shoves Rigby. He falls off the microwave and yells, and his body disintegrates and becomes dust. Rigby is dead)

Mordecai: RIGBY!!! No, that's not what I meant! That's not what I meant! Go back! Go back, go back, go back! (The teleportation is now done, and is now in a dark abyss, and bumps into an invisible blockade, which destroys the microwave) (echo) Hello? (walks around, and keeps bumping into the invisible blockade.)

Father Time: Hey! Who's screwing around up there? (Then there is a bunch of clocks floating around, revealing a man made out of clocks) Oh, it's you.

Mordecai: Who are you?

Father Time: I am Father Time. And you're the one who's been running around microwaving all my clocks.

Mordecai: I didn't mean too.

Father Time: (sarcastically) "You didn't mean too." You've wasted my time, your time, and you really wasted the time of that guy you killed. He's dead.

Mordecai: I know, I'm sorry. Can you bring him back?

Father Time: No, his body has been blown to bits of star-stuff. And now, you get to spend eternity here at the end of time. All because of your pity jealousy.

Mordecai: I'm not jealous.

Father Time: Yes, you are!

Mordecai: No, I'm not!

Father Time: Silence! Peer into my Truth Hole. (the clocks that make up his body pull back to reveal an enormous hourglass right before Mordecai's very eyes)

Mordecai: What is that? (The Truth Hole reveals all of the times where Mordecai is jealous throughout the entire episode) It's true, I am jealous of Rigby, and even though he's annoying, he's still my best friend. You're right Father Time, I deserve to be trapped here.

Father Time: I'll be honest, Mordecai, house guests really annoy me, I mean just look how you wreaked my living room. (Reveals nothing, since it's invisible)

Mordecai: (faking it) Oh, sorry.

Father Time: You better be. Now, I'll give you a do-over just this once.

Mordecai: Aww, man. Thanks so much.

Father Time: But remember, stop bottling up your emotions, because if I ever get you back here again, you'll be sorry. Now, get on the Time Pony.

Mordecai: Time Pony?

Father Time: Aww, come on, it's right next to you. (Revealing to be invisible) There you go. (Mordecai gets on the pony) That's how you ride a Time Pony?

Mordecai: What?

Father Time: That's just weird. Now get out of my dimension.

(The Time Pony rides off, redoing back to the coffee shop, where the episode started)

Mordecai: Rigby! You're-you're here!

Rigby: Shhh! We're watching the trailer.

Announcer: Zombie Dinner Party.

Mordecai: That looks awesome.

Rigby: I'm glad you said that, because I got us... BAM!!! (throws 2 tickets on the table) 2 tickets for opening night! Wanna go with me?

Mordecai: Yes I do. (Rigby smiles)

Margaret: Hey, guys, your food's almost ready, sorry for the hold-up.

Mordecai: Hey, Margaret. (Grabs a coffee cup) Uh, looks like you've got a latte on your plate. (laughs nervously)

Rigby: You're gonna have to excuse Mordecai here. He has a hard time trying to "espresso" himself.

Margaret: (laughs) Good one, Rigby. I'll be right back with your food, guys.

Rigby: Dude, did you see how hard Margaret laughed at me? (Mordecai now looks jealous, again) Oh, dude, you're jealous! Admit it!

Mordecai: Dude, I'm not-- Well, maybe just a little bit.

Benson: The next person receiving an appreciation plaque is... Skips. (applauds) It says here in the Book of Park Records that you went the whole year without taking a day off.

Muscle Man: Oh, man, that's like, 400 days!

(Mordecai and Rigby look at Muscle Man in confusion)

Benson: Thanks, Skips, we appreciate it. The next is... Pops.

Pops: Hooray!

Benson: For helping a baby bird back into its nest.

Mordecai: Oh dude, we're next.

Rigby: That plaque is gonna look sweet hanging on over my bed.

Mordecai: Yeah. Finally some recognition. (high-fives)

Benson: And last, but not least, two guys who really pulled it together this year. Two guys that remind us to not just work hard, but to work hard at having a good time. Two guys that we couldn't do without. And these two guys are Mmmm... Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost.

Muscle Man: WOOOOOOOOOOOO! Yeah! Eat on that, Mordecai and Rigby!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five ghost go into the golf cart).

(Muscle Man drives in a circle).

Muscle Man: WOOOOOOOO! WOOOOO! WOOOOOOOO!

(Muscle Man drives away).

Mordecai: Come on Benson, what about us?

Benson: Oh, yeah. Mordecai and Rigby. Let's see, let's see. (closes book) Clean up this mess.

(Benson starts to walk away).

Mordecai: Wait, Benson. What about our appreciation plaques?

Benson: In order to get a plaque, you have to do something that's appreciated. And according to The Book of Park Records, all you guys do is mess up and slack off.

Mordecai: We do stuff for The Park all the time.

Rigby: Yeah, there has got to be something good about us in that book.

(Rigby reaches for the book but Benson pulls back).

Benson: This book is a record of everything that has ever happened in The Park. It's been handed down from manager to manager since The Park's founding. It's a sacred document, so keep your dirty hands off.

Mordecai: Can't you fund in a bit to make us look better?

Benson: No, I can only write the truth, and the truth is I don't appreciate you.

(Benson drives away).

Rigby: Awwwwwww, I can't believe this.

Mordecai: Relax, dude. We just need to do some work so he'll see what awesome employees we are. I bet if he sees us doing one job, he'll totally appreciate us.

Rigby: Yeah! We'll make him appreciate us so hard, we'll be the ones handing out the plaques. To.....ourselves.

(The scene then cuts to Mordecai and Rigby raking leaves. Mordecai points out Benson riding up to them on the golf cart. Mordecai and Rigby start to rake the leaves. When the golf cart comes up to them, it turns out it was Pops. Pops waves to them. Mordecai and Rigby then start to fight, and end up in the leaves beating each other up. Benson walks up to them and sees them beating each other up. Then he writes something about them in The Book of Park Records. The scene then cuts again to Mordecai and Rigby mowing the lawn. Rigby points out Benson. Mordecai then makes the lawn mower goes too fast, resulting in them almost running over Benson and both of them crash into a tree. Benson writes something about them in The Book of Park Records. The scene then cuts once again to Mordecai and Rigby painting the house. Rigby and Mordecai are painting when the ladder Rigby is standing on falls over and knocks into Mordecai. The paint bucket Mordecai was holding drops. The paint lands on the golf cart, and Benson once again, writes something about them in The Book of Park Records).

(We then cut Mordecai and Rigby cleaning the golf cart with sponges).

Mordecai: Aww, this is hopeless! Benson is never gonna appreciate us! Anyone who reads that book will think we're complete slackers.

Rigby: What if we change it? We can re-write it, so we look like the employees of the century!

Mordecai: Dude. Let's go change that book.

(Scene goes to Mordecai and Rigby sneaking into Benson's office).

Rigby: (Looks around the room) The coast is clear.

Mordecai: The Book of Park Records.

(The book suddenly moves in Mordecai's hand).

Rigby: Dude, open it up.

Mordecai: I don't know, man. Maybe we shouldn't do this. What if we aren't meant to see what's inside?

Rigby: Pfft. If we were not supposed to see what's inside, they shouldn't have taught us how to read. (Looks in the pages in the book).I found our names!

Mordecai: Give me that.

(Mordecai takes the book back from Rigby).

Rigby: Hey!

Mordecai: Mordecai and Rigby are lazy, GOOD-FOR-NOTHING SLACKERS? Awww!

Rigby: It's kind of true.

Mordecai: Their continued employment is one of life's greatest mysteries? Can't be taught, untrustworthy, useless, destruction of park property?

Rigby: Oh sure, that one time.

Mordecai: A GENERAL WASTE OF TIME, ENERGY, AND SPACE?!

Rigby: Ugh! Anyone who reads that is gonna think we're complete tools. (Kicks the phone).

Mordecai: No, they're not. Let's change this stupid book. Mordecai and Rigby are my two favorite employees.

Rigby: Let me try. Every morning Mordecai and Rigby make blueberry pancakes, do the dishes, and wash the floor.

Mordecai: I save all my hardest jobs for them.

Rigby: They're always sweating from all the hard work they do.

Mordecai: Hahahaha! They're the most reliable guys I ever met.

Rigby: I trust them with my own life.

Mordecai: Wait, wait. I got one. Check it. There was this blizzard, and Skips broke his leg, but it didn't matter because Mordecai and Rigby took him to the hospital.

Rigby: Hahaha! They totally took him to the hospital!

Mordecai: Yeah, the emergency part of the hospital!

Rigby: Then they were suddenly attacked by Snowballs the Ice Monster. It was like 20 feet tall with-

(The duo hear footsteps coming toward them and see the doorknob start to move).

Mordecai: Dude, it's Benson. Dude, we gotta get out of here.

Rigby: Wait, I'm not done!

Mordecai: Rigby!

Benson: (Benson walks into the room, looking at his desk). There it is. (He walks to his desk and picks up The Book of Park Records) Huh? Hmmmmm... (Leaves the room).

Rigby: Awww, man, I didn't get to write the ending!

Mordecai: Whatever, dude. It's not like anyone is gonna believe that stuff. Just be glad we didn't get caught.

(The scene then cuts to the next day, where Mordecai and Rigby are in the kitchen).

Rigby: Are those pancakes? I smell pancakes.

Mordecai: Blueberry? Man, those smell good.

Rigby: Yeah. Who's making them?

Benson: What are you two slackers- (Sniffs the air) Wow, Rigby, those smell great.

Rigby: Yeah, but-

Benson: Are they ready yet? I'm starving.

Rigby: Ugh, sure.

Benson: (Eats a pancake) Rigby, these are incredible. Thanks. You made my morning. Oh, no. Oh, no you didn't. Did you guys do the dishes too?

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugh, yeah.

Benson: And you washed the floor?

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah!

Benson: Oh, man I appreciate that, you know I do.

(Benson, Mordecai, and Rigby all high five each other).

All 3: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!!!

Benson: I need reliable guys like you to do some hard jobs for me today. Are you in?

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah...

(Various scenes cut to Mordecai and Rigby doing a ton of hard jobs).

Rigby: Ugh! It's so hot. I can't stop sweating.

Mordecai: Dude, is it just me, or does being appreciated blow?

Rigby: Yeah man. It's not worth it.

(Pops drives by).

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, did you hear? There's to be a blizzard this afternoon!

Mordecai: But it's the middle of Summer.

Pops: I know, but look! (shows he has tennis rackets tied to his feet) I've already donned my snowshoes.

Rigby: Pfft, snow? Sounds like more crazy Pops talk to me, right?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Start laughing)

(A giant blizzard appears out of nowhere).

Mordecai: This is crazy!

Rigby: Dude, I think it's the book!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Don't you get it? The pancakes, Benson liking us, the work, this blizzard!

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!

(We then see Mordecai and Rigby driving the golf cart).

Mordecai: Dude, how are we gonna find him? I can't see anything!

Rigby: Just keep going! (The duo crash into something) What was that?

(Mordecai and Rigby get out of the cart and realize that they ran over Skips).

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!

(Mordecai and Rigby lift Skips up. His leg is broken because of the crash, making him scream)

Rigby: That's not good.

Mordecai: Help me get him into the cart!

(Mordecai and Rigby get Skips into the cart and drive away. They keep driving until the cart gets stuck in the snow.)

Rigby: Oh no! We're dead!

Mordecai: Wait here!

(Mordecai runs away).

Rigby: Mordecai! Come back!

(Mordecai uses a snow machine to clear all the snow. We then see a giant piece of ice starts to fall).

Rigby: Look out! (Mordecai notices the ice and runs away just in time. A giant ice monster resembling a spice worm from Dune appears out of a block of snow.) I don't remember writing that in the book.

Mordecai: You had to say Snowballs the Ice Monster?

Rigby: He doesn't look that bad.

Mordecai: Fire? You made him breathe fire? Are you kidding?

Rigby: It's looking at us! (The duo drive away.) This is all your fault!

Mordecai: You were the one who wanted to change the book.

Skips: You wrote lies in the Book of Park Records?

Mordecai: Maybe...

Rigby: Yeah, well... You're the one who made me stop writing. There's gonna be a super sweet ending with bazookas, and explosions, and a heli--

Mordecai: Rigby, the book. If everything we write in the book comes true, then all we need to do is... (gasp)

Mordecai and Rigby: We gotta find Benson.

(The duo meet Benson near Pops’ house.)

Benson: Hey, just the guys I wanted to see. I’ve got your appreciation plaques.

Mordecai: (grabs the Book of Park Records from Benson) Not now. I'm gonna make everything go back to normal.

Rigby: Wait, you're not gonna change everything back, right? At least, leave some of the good stuff.

(Snowballs the Ice Monster grabs the book from Mordecai.)

Mordecai: The book! (Mordecai and Rigby chase after the Monster. The Monster rips the pages out of the book and tosses them away.) NOOO!

Rigby: (Snatches all the pages) Mordecai, hurry! Write something!

Mordecai: "...then the monster breathed fire on itself and he melted." (The Monster is still alive and it burns park visitors’ cars.) "...and then the monster disappeared forever."

(The Monster burns Pops’ house.)

Rigby: Why isn't it working?

Skips: (drives past them in the cart) Because he still has the cover!

(Skips drives towards the Monster as fast as he can. He steps on the gas and increases the speed even more that makes his cart fly. The cart crashes into the Monster’s arm that makes the book cover fall to the ground. Rigby speeds towards the cover.)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(While Rigby runs towards the cover of the book, Snowballs the Ice Monster notices him running to get the book cover and chases after him. Rigby speeds as fast as he can to get the cover, and jumps in the air, just when Snowballs was just about to bite him, and finally grabs the cover. Then, Rigby notices that Snowballs was running towards him, getting ready to swallow him.)

Rigby: Mordecai, catch!

(Rigby throws the cover to Mordecai and right after that Snowballs swallows him. Mordecai grabs the cover of the Book of Park Records, restores the book, and starts to write in it.)

Mordecai: "...and the monster went away and everything went back to normal."

(Snowballs the Ice Monster was about to eat Mordecai, but the melts down to ground, and then, the snow from Snowballs absorbs into a little snowball and completely blows up. And just like that, everything was all back to normal.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa.... Cool...

Benson: I'll take that. (snatches the book from Mordecai) I don't know what's been going on here, or why you two jokers have my book, so you had better clean this mess up starting now, or YOU’RE BOTH FIRED!

Mordecai: What mess?

(Benson looks around and sees no mess at all.)

Benson: Uh...

Rigby: We did all the jobs you asked us to do.

Benson: Skips, let's get out of here.

(Benson and Skips drive away in the cart.)

Rigby: What? Still no appreciation plaques?

Mordecai: Okay. (rubs eyes) Ready?

Rigby: (rubs eyes) Give me a second! (blinks) Ready.

Mordecai: Stare!

(silence for a few seconds, then, Rigby starts making faces, arm-farting and dancing)

Rigby: Ooh, I think you gonna blink.

Mordecai: Yeah, right.

Rigby: Ha! (longer silence. Rigby starts sweating, then, he pulls out a laser pointer) Pschoooo!

Mordecai: Hey, no laser pointers! That's not regulation!

Rigby: Street rules, man.

(Benson observes the action from the window)

Benson: What are you doing? I asked you to wash the truck 20 minutes ago! I can't trust you guys to do anything!

Mordecai: Uh, we were just taking a break.

(M&R go back to washing the truck.)

Benson: Ugh. (walks off, but then, decides to turn around to see if M&R are still working. They're back to their staring contest. Benson holds in his rage and when he is about to say something.) I--

Infomercial VO: Bosses! Are you sick of slackers?

Benson: Yeah.

(the TV is on a commercial)

Infomercial VO: Is this a familiar sight?

(The TV shows two cafe workers asleep.)

Infomercial VO: Well, turn this... (slackers are now working hard, with many cameras surrounding them) ...to this! Peeps! Get your workers to work harder!

Manager: Thanks, Peeps.

Infomercial VO: Now with 4 different levels! (the captions "Mooch Master", "Slack Pack" and "Bum Blitz" appear as the levels are said) Level 1, Level 2, Level 3, and for the ultimate in worker productivity... (cut to another caption. The words appear as said:) Jeepers Peepers X-Infinity, with a Peeps lifetime guarantee! Act now and get the Peeps lens cleaning kit, free! Call now! Cleaning can be extremely flammable. Offer not valid or void. Peeps may be illegal in your country or province. Requires sign...

(clock transition to another M&R staring contest, some time later)

Benson: Hey, you two.

(M&R turn their heads to see Benson, with the new Peeps kit)

Mordecai: Oh, uh, hey Benson. We were just getting back to work.

Benson: It's okay, Mordecai. I trust you.

Mordecai: Really?

Benson: Of course I do, because now I have this. (assembles the Mooch Master) Say hello to Peeps. It's a surveillance system. Now I'll be able to see what you're up to all the time, 24/7, 365. Isn't that great? (throws rag to Mordecai and hands bucket to Rigby) Well, I'll let you guys finish your work. And remember, I'm watching you. (whistles)

Rigby: Dude, I don't think Benson trusts us at all.

Mordecai: Of course he doesn't. He just put a camera in front of us.

Rigby: What's the big deal, anyway? I mean, we were working. We're gonna get it done.

Mordecai: Come on. We'll show him. We'll get this done in no time.

(M&R get to washing the car. Five minutes later, M&R are working at a much slower pace. The Mooch Master camera lens zooms in)

Rigby: Dude, forget this. Let's just finish our staring contest.

Mordecai: We can't. Benson's watching us.

(zoom into the lens. M&R are seen washing the car from the computer. Benson and Skips come into the room)

Benson: You gotta check this out, Skips. Those slackers are finally working. Yep, Peeps is working like a charm.

Skips: Why is there a jet outside?

Benson: Huh? (A crude drawing of M&R washing the car and a jet saying "You guys are doing great" is shown.) What? (cut to outside. Benson sees the paper covering the lens and rips it off) RAUGGH!

(M&R notice)

Mordecai: Oh! Benson, uh--

Benson: Get back to work! Now! (M&R quickly get back to washing the car. Benson goes over to call Peeps) I'm gonna take those slackers to level 2.

Phone operator: You have reached Peeps. Please hold.

(clock transition to coffee shop. M&R are now wearing the Slack Pack. Mordecai's camera gets caught, but he moves it in to proceed with Rigby)

Mordecai: This, Sucks.

Rigby: I know! Mine's really chaffing me.

Mordecai: Well, at least we're on break. We can finish our staring contest.

Rigby: Yeah, it's on.

(they start, but the Slack Pack camera blocks Mordecai's view)

Mordecai: Ugh, this is lame.

Margaret: Next. Hey guys. What's with the cameras?

Mordecai: These? Um, we're making an Indie documentary.

Margaret: Whoa, that's cool.

Mordecai: Yeah, it's pretty obscure art house stuff.

Rigby: It's so Indie, only one dude's gonna see it.

Margaret: What's it called?

Benson: (over microphone) It's called "Slackers 2: The Return of Mordecai and Rigby To Their Jobs". Break's over!

Mordecai: Uh, I guess we'll take two lattes.

Benson: (over microphone) To go!

(clock transition back to the house. Benson observes M&R washing the dishes before Pops comes in)

Pop​s: Ooh! What a fancy new fangled giga! How does it work?

Benson: Pops, come here and I'll show you. It's called Peeps. This window here, is hooked up to a camera on Rigby, and this one, is hooked up to Mordecai. It's foolproof. They'll never slack off again.

Pops: Hmm? Oh, I meant that. (plays with computer mouse)

Benson: Wow, I can't believe they've been working for 3 hours.

Pops: 3 hours? They deserve an award!

Benson: Good idea. Time to bust out the Employee Incentives. I hope these babies are still good. (pulls out coupon)

Pops: Ooh! Luigi's One Free Personal Pizza with purchase of equal or greater pizza!

Benson: Let's go!

(cut to kitchen)

Pops: Mordecai and Rigby, we've got coupons!

Benson: What the? (dishes are still dirty. pan over to a TV showing a split-screen of dishwashing, with the Slack Packs pointed at two different sides. Benson ejects the tape from the TV) World Dishwashing Championship 1982?!

(M&R are heard upstairs)

Rigby: You blinked!

Mordecai: You wish.

Benson: That's it. I gotta make a phone call.

(Begin a montage of the Bum Blitz cameras. Mordecai is asleep, and wakes up to a camera. Mordecai screams, then, we see that the whole bedroom has cameras all over it. Mordecai removes his sheets to reveal that there are even cameras under his sheet)

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: (bonks head against camera) Oww! (from lens) What the?

(Benson watches from all the cameras in his office. He's somehow grown a five o'clock shadow)

Benson: Ha!

(M&R are at the window. We pan to see that there are cameras all throughout the park)

Mordecai: Crap.

(M&R eat breakfast under the watchful eyes of the cameras. Later, they are also seen driving the cart, also camera-equipped. Cameras are even seen in the bathroom, four of which are seen on a toilet)

Mordecai: Dude, this has to stop.

(Benson's office, night. M&R sneak in. Benson is asleep at his desk.)

Mordecai: Did you bring the hacking device? (Rigby pulls out a canister filled with coffee from a sack. Mordecai drinks some of it) Ahhhhhh...

(In one move, Mordecai spills coffee onto the keyboard, shutting off all the cameras. Benson wakes up to see the mess)

Benson: Huh? What the? (M&R run out of the room. Benson sees the canister on the ground) AAAGGGHHH!

(pulls out the Peeps manual and flips through the pages, then, he grabs a phone and calls Peeps)

Phone operator: Peeps Surveillance Systems.

Benson: Yeah. Upgrade me to Jeepers Peepers X-Infinity! NOW!

Phone operator: I'm sorry, sir, but that requires a signature (Benson grimaces in frustration) on our lifetime contract.

(Puts down the phone and rips a few pages in manual then throwing it down and violently sliding it off the desk)

Benson: Alright! Whatever, just make it happen.

Phone operator: One moment, please.

(A contract comes through Benson's system. Benson grabs the contract and signs)

Benson: There.

Phone operator: Thank you for choosing Peeps Surveillance Systems. (contract disappears into thin air) Have a nice day.

(eyeballs appear on the screens. Benson turns to the fourth wall and laughs maniacally. In the morning, the Peeps truck backs up into the driveway just as Benson runs up laughing maniacally again to see the Jeepers Creepers X-Infinity. The back doors open, revealing a huge eye)

Benson: AAAH! What are you?

Peeps Eyeball: I'm Peeps.

(zooms into eye to start montage of Peeps spying on the park workers. M&R are first. They look behind them to see the Peeps Eyeball following them. Next up is Pops, who is taking a shower. He opens the curtains to see the Peeps Eyeball, and then quickly backs away in fear. Third are Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost. MM twirls his shirt around in the air while watching a monster trucks show before the Peeps Eyeball comes on screen to scare Muscle Man & Hi Five Ghost, prompting Muscle Man to put his shirt back on. Fourth is Skips. He fixes a bus, before sliding under it, only to see the Peeps Eyeball looking down upon him. Finally, Benson runs through a green void in fear as Peeps Eyeballs show up throughout his path. Then, all the park workers are seen running through the bottom lid of the Peeps Eyeball, as its pupil follows them. They then are seen on the golf cart. Benson hits the accelerator as the Peeps Eyeball disappears. They think they lost it, but all of a sudden, it comes right up again. As they exit the cart, the Peeps Eyeball teleports to the top of the house.)

Mordecai: Benson! This has gone too far!

Skips: Yeah. I can't work.

Pops: I haven't been able to sleep in a fortnight!

Muscle Man: I've been so stressed that I'm losing muscle mass...

Benson: I know you guys. I'm gonna take care of this mess. Peeps. Hey, Peeps.

Peeps Eyeball: (teleports right to Benson) Yes?

Benson: Listen, Peeps. You're creeping everyone out. You've got to go.

Peeps Eyeball: I'm here to stay. If you've read the lifetime guarantee that you signed, I'm going to watch you 24/7, 365, until you die.

Benson: GRAAAH! (rips contract to pieces)

Peeps Eyeball: That's cool. I made copies.

Mordecai: Peeps. We've got a proposition for you.

Peeps Eyeball: Oh yeah, what?

Mordecai: A staring contest. (Skips, Hi Five Ghost, Muscle Man and Pops doubt Mordecai) If we win, you have to leave the park.

Peeps Eyeball: What? Ha ha! Are you kidding me? You don't stand a chance.

Rigby: You're the one that doesn't have a chance, you giant eye sack.

Peeps Eyeball: Fine. But if I win, I'm taking your eyes. All of your eyes. (pulls out spoon and needle on the gang)

Mordecai: Accepted.

Benson: Wait, you guys can't even do the dishes. How can I trust you to win?

Mordecai: It's true, Benson. You can't trust us to do the dishes or wash the truck.

Rigby: And you really can't trust us not to fart in your coffee when you're not looking.

Benson: What?

Mordecai: Nothing. But what you can trust us is at pointless skills during work time.

Benson: Wow. I really can't argue with that. I guess it's our only chance.

Peeps Eyeball: So, which one of you is it gonna be then?

Rigby: Mordecai, you should do it. You're a way better starer than me. Ice this fool!

Peeps Eyeball: Mordecai, your eyeballs are mine.

(some time later, Mordecai and Peeps prepare to start)

Skips: Ready, set, sssssss...stare!

(a mini-montage begins. The gang watches as Mordecai and Peeps go into the evening without blinking. Their eyes are now red. The Peeps Eyeball squints)

Rigby: Peeps is gonna blink! You got this, Mordecai!

(a little eyeball comes out of Peeps' back and rubs his big eye. Everyone gasps and Benson nearly pukes but he puts his hands over his mouth to stop it.)

Rigby: Hey, that's cheating!

Peeps Eyeball: I'm not blinking, am I?

Rigby: Hmph.

Peeps Eyeball: (dozens of his eyes come out) Don't blink. Don't blink, don't blink, don't blink, don't blink, don't blink, don't blink, don't blink. Don't blink! HA HA HA HA-- (laughs, and then, all of a sudden Rigby shoots one of his eyes with a laser pointer) Ow! Hey, that's cheating!

Rigby: You cheated first. Now it's time to kiss your greasy eye sacks good night.

(Rigby makes gunshot noises as he shoots the lasers at his eyes. It lasts for about 20 seconds before the little eyes are all burnt out)

Peeps Eyeball: My retinas... They burn...

Mordecai: Hey, Peeps. Don't blink.

(Mordecai stares hard at Peeps before he finally closes his eye. The gang cheers)

Peeps Eyeball: This isn't a regulation, you know....

Rigby: Street rules, man.

(He shoots Peeps' big eye with the laser pointer, setting his eye on fire)

Peeps Eyeball: AAAAAGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!

(Peeps jumps into the lake, letting out steam. Wipe transition to Peeps being saved by an ambulance as others watch)

Peeps Eyeball: All I see is darkness...

(The ambulance drives away. The park workers cheer)

Benson: Get out and stay out! And you two, I hope you learned something from all this.

Rigby: Yeah, make sure we do our chores so you don't mark on us to a giant eyeball.

Muscle Man: I learned that Mordecai can go for a really long time without blinking.

Mordecai: Actually, my eyes won't blink anymore. (the others go "oooooh" in shock) Uh... does anybody have any eye drops?

(Rigby gives him eye drops. Mordecai lets a drop over his eye, but it evaporates before touching it and he still wouldn't blink)

Mordecai: Take me to the hospital.

Benson: It's always good to have you at the park, Mr. Maellard, sir.

Mr. Maellard: (turns to face Benson & Skips) Don't try to fraternize with me, Bert.

Benson: Actually, sir, my name is Benson.

Mr. Maellard: I know what your name is, Beanbag! So, everything is ready for the unveiling of the new statue today, right, Beanbag?

Benson: Yes, sir. The catering's all set up, and the sound system is in place...

Mr. Maellard: Good. Great. Only one thing missing. My son! (shows portrait of Pops) Pops! When I told him he had to give a speech today, he ran away, crying. I didn't invite all my friends and waste a lot of money for nothing! Right, Beanteen?

Benson: Uh, no, sir.

Mr. Maellard: Now you go find Pops so he can give his speech, or you're fired! Underline, FIRED!!!

(cut to seconds later, with the door slamming)

Skips: So, what do we do first?

Benson: Find Pops, and make sure Mordecai and Rigby don't mess this up.

(clock transition to the swingset. Pops is sitting on one of the swings, sobbing, as Mordecai and Rigby walk up)

Mordecai: Hey Pops, is everything okay?

Pops: No. My father wants me to give a speech in front of all his friends today. But I can't, because I'm a no-good turkey and I'm going to strawberry jam the whole thing up! (M&R look at each other)

Rigby: What are you saying?

Pops: I'm just saying, I can't... I don't know why, I just get terribly anxious when I give speeches...

Rigby: I give speeches all the time. It's easy.

Mordecai: When do you ever give speeches?

Rigby: What? It's like, just, talking in front of a bunch of people. We talk in front of each other all the time.

Mordecai: Actually, yeah. We do do that. (to Pops) See, Pops? We can totally help you get over your nerves.

Pops: Oh, thank you!

(clock transition to another part of the park, next to a lamppost covered with notes)

Mordecai: Okay, Pops. I want you to pretend there's a crowd of people here. But, they're all your family and friends. You know, people who it's easy for you to talk to. (backs away) And... go!

Pops: Oh! Uh... (pulls out notecard from his vest) I need my notes. Let's see. Umm... (notices the emptiness) Where did everyone go? They must have hated my speech.

Mordecai: No, Pops. Just pretend there are people there.

Pops: (turns to emptiness, then back to M&R) I'm not very good at pretending.

Rigby: I got this. (goes to lamppost to grab a band for hire ad and puts it over Pop's eyes) Here. Pretend these dudes are your friends and family in the crowd.

Pops: Where did these people come from?

Rigby: Okay, Pops. Give it a shot. (turns Pops to the right)

Pops: Okay, um... (pause) NO! NO! Get away! (starts running around. The ad shakes as he moves) STOP FOLLOWING ME! (runs into lamppost)

Mordecai: Maybe we should just find you some real people to practice on.

(mini-montage of Pops struggling to give his speech in front of people at a baseball stadium, concert hall, movie theater, restaurant, hospital and job interview. Cut to the park where Pops is still sobbing.)

Mordecai: Okay. Obviously, this isn't working.

Rigby: I guess Pops will just never be able to give his speech, you know what I'm saying? (Mordecai punches Rigby) Owww... How you holding up there, Pops?

Pops: Oh, I just don't think I can do it.

Mordecai: Hey, I know. Why don't you just picture everybody naked?

Pops: Naked?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Pops: Okay... (looks at Mordecai & Rigby to see that they are already naked) I don't like doing this...

Rigby: Ugh. I don't know, why don't you just spin around and get dizzy or something?

Mordecai: What? How's that gonna do anything?

Rigby: It makes more sense than looking at naked people. (to Pops) Pops, what would you rather do? Spin around and get dizzy, or look at naked people?

Pops: Get dizzy.

Rigby: Hmph. Hmhmph. Hmhmph. Why don't you give it a try, Pops?

Pops: (slowly) Okay. (MR&P stand up)

Mordecai: Ready?

Pops: Uh-huh.

Mordecai: Now spin! (Pops starts spinning faster and faster)

Pops: Oh, yes!

Mordecai: Is it working?

Pops: (the world around him becomes warped as he laughs) Oh my, it's true! (sees blurry Mordecai & Rigby) I'm not nervous anymore! (laughs) It's working, it's working! (cut to the job interview, hospital, restaurant, movie theater, concert hall and baseball field, in that order, before we cut back to the park) I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! I'm not nervous! (laughs) I'm gonna do it! I'm gonna give the best speech I've ever given!

(cut to another part of the park. Benson and Skips run up to each other)

Benson: I can't find Pops. Did you see him?

Skips: No. I checked everywhere. (Muscle Man is seen mowing the lawn in the distance)

Benson: Muscle Man, have you seen Pops at all today?

Muscle Man: Yeah. And you know who else has seen Pops today?

Benson: Who, your mom?

Muscle Man: I wasn't gonna say that. Why does everyone always think I'm gonna say "my mom"? I saw Pops earlier by the playground, with those two losers.

Benson: Oh, great. Mordecai and Rigby found him first.

Skips: We better find him, quick.

(cut to where Mordecai Rigby & Pops are. Pops is still spinning around)

Mordecai and Rigby: Okay Pops, you can stop now.

Pops: But I have to keep spinning until I give my speech. Did I tell you I'm not nervous anymore?

Mordecai: Yeah, you did.

Rigby: A bunch of times, actually.

Pops: Isn't it wonderful? I think I'm finally ready. (Pops starts to get dizzy)

Mordecai and Rigby: Careful, Pops!

(Pops stumbles as he stops spinning, eventually falling into a portal in the ground. Pops screams as he falls through the green void. The background changes from radar circles, to kaleidoscopic blue shapes, and finally, white with black lines. Pops' mustache disintegrates, then, he's stripped naked from the gravity around him. He stops screaming for a moment as he realizes it's just a white void, but resumes screaming when the gravity comes back in. He then falls into a pink pool that leads to a land down below. His clothes and mustache are restored as his hat falls onto his head. In the distance, he sees other creatures dressed like him, one of them, a goldfish that comes up and scares Pops. Back on the surface world, Mordecai & Rigby look upon the knocked-out Pops)

Rigby: Is he dead? (Pops moans)

Mordecai: Oh, dude. He must have passed out from spinning too much.

Rigby: (pulls out marker) Never pass out, when there's markers about!

Mordecai: Dude, this isn't some sleepover, this is serious! (Mordecai & Rigby go down to Pops and flip him over. Pops moans again) Oh, man. I'm gonna get help. (runs off) You stay with Pops!

(ripple transition into Pops' unconscious world. They have all surrounded him. From the distance, realistic-looking versions of Mordecai and Rigby, Iacedrom and Ygbir, arrive.)

Pops: (Feeling scared) Oh, my!

Iacedrom: (squawks at Pops, and then coughs) Sorry about that. I am Iacedrom.

Ygbir: And I, Ygbir. (takes off hat to reveal ice cream)

Iacedrom: Would you like some ice cream?

Pops: Oh yes, of course!

Iacedrom: So what brings you here, traveller?

Pops: Hmm? Well, I was just getting over my fear of giving speeches. (the crowd voices in their opinion)

Iacedrom: Indeed. We all hate speeches! In fact, we outlawed them.

Ygbir: Yes, yes. Quite illegal. In here, it is forbidden to give speeches just as it is forbidden not to enjoy ice cream.

Pops: Oh, what a relief!

Iacedrom and Ygbir: Good show!

Pops: Jolly good show indeed!

(cut to the surface world. Rigby is already defacing Pops with the marker. He snickers as Mordecai, Benson and Skips drive up with the cart)

Benson: Oh no, what are you doing?! Get away from him! (looks at Pops' drawn-on face) Rigby!

Rigby: Sorry, it's a nervous habit. You guys were taking forever.

Benson: This is a disaster! Look at him! (Mordecai & Rigby snicker) It's not funny! (to Skips) Skips, what do we do?

Skips: (puts his head against Pops) You shouldn't have made him spin like that. (goes to the cart and grabs a red box) You're gonna have to go in after him.

Rigby: Go in where?

Skips: Into Pops. (Mordecai & Rigby look at each other, and grab hold of each other's hands)

Rigby: Make this quick. I don't want people to think we're holding hands or something.

Mordecai: Just spin.

(Mordecai & Rigby start spinning around in circles, while Skips flexes the rope. As they get dizzy, Skips starts to lasso the rope. Finally, Mordecai & Rigby let go)

Mordecai: (dizzy) Don't worry Pops, we're coming...

(Skips throws the rope around Mordecai and Rigby before they fall into Pops' head. They scream as they fall through the void before falling into the pink pool that leads into the Dizzy World. Mordecai & Rigby see Pops in front of Iacedrom & Ygbir and the other citizens of the Dizzy world)

Rigby: Look, there's Pops!

Mordecai: Pops, Pops!

(Pops hears them and looks up at them)

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, hello!

Mordecai: Pops, we have come to bring you back!

Pops: But I don't want to come back. I like it here.

Mordecai: But what about your speech?

Pops: I don't want to give the speech.

Rigby: But we spent all that time preparing! Are you just gonna blow it off now?

Pops: Yes.

Mordecai: This is ridiculous! Come on Pops, let's go! You're coming back with us!

Pops: (acts immature and turns the other way, crossing his arms) No, I'm not!

Mordecai: (sternly) Pops, let's go.

Pops: (angry) I said no! (silence for a second)...Now listen here, I have gone through enough turmoil because of that confounded speech. Why is it me that needs to speak? Surely, there are those more qualified than I. I hate speaking in front of crowds. And we have tried every which way for it to work, but I just simply cannot do it. Why am I like this? I don't know, but surely my father must understand that there are limits to my abilities. I'll never ever be able to give a speech, and that's just fine by me.

(Mordecai & Rigby look at each other, surprised)

Mordecai: Never say never, Pops!

Pops: What do you mean?

Mordecai: You just gave a speech!

Pops: (startled, and turns to the crowd) Oh my, I did! (turns back to Mordecai & Rigby) I did give a speech!

Rigby: Yeah! I guess you didn't get nervous because you were not facing the crowd!

Pops: It's true, I didn't feel nervous at all. (Runs up to Iacedrom & Ygbir) Friends, I'm sorry, but I have to leave you now. (dramatic music ensues)

Iacedrom: Indeed. You do have to leave, for you have broken the law!

Ygbir: No speeches! (Iacedrom & Ygbir hiss and squawk, scaring Pops. Then, Iacedrom lunges his beak towards Pops, but Pops runs for cover. Ygbir also tries to catch Pops within his teeth)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops!

Mordecai: (to Skips, in the real world) Skips, drop us lower! (Skips lowers the rope, and his arm, into the unconcious Pops) More, Skips!

Skips: That's all we got.

(Ygbir corners Pops as he tries to run away, so Pops tries to run in the opposite direction, before being blocked off by Iacedrom, who picks up Pops by the head with his beak, then, throws him over go of him into Mordecai & Rigby, Are still holding the rope)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops!

Mordecai: (to Skips) Skips, pull us up!

(the rope is pulled back into the skies of the Dizzy World, just as Iacedrom flies towards Mordecai, Rigby, & Pops. The three then make it into the pink void, causing Iacedrom to hit his head on the matter. In the real world, Mordecai & Rigby are pulled back in through Pops' head. When they are out, Pops comes to, wondering what happened.)

Benson: Pops, you're awake!

Pops: Benson, my good man. Pardon me, I just came back from that strange and wonderful place.

Benson: Okay, sure, but can you still give the speech?

Pops: Oh yes, I am finally prepared.

Benson: Thank goodness. We just have to get this trash off his face.

Mordecai: Nah, it's cool. Pops is gonna give his speech facing backwards anyway so...

Benson: What? You idiots! This isn't some kind of joke! He can't give a major speech in front of a distinguished crowd facing backwards. If Mr. Maellard sees this, we're all gonna get fired.

Mordecai: (to Rigby) Give me the marker. (Rigby gives the marker to Mordecai) Turn around, Pops.

(Mordecai turns Pops around so the back of his head shows, then, draws a face, similar to Pops', on his head. Then, Skips puts the hat on. Everyone but Benson seems satisfied)

Benson: We're dead.

(clock transition to the ceremony, some time later. Pops is at the podium. His still-trashed side pulls out the card with his speech as Mordecai & Rigby nod. Then, Pops gives his speech)

Pops: Ahem. Ladies and gentlemen, I hereby dedicate this new statue to the Park.

(The crowd claps)

Gentlemen: Bravo. Bravo.

Mordecai and Rigby: That's the whole speech?

Gentleman: You've got a fine boy there, Maellard.

(Pops, his real face hidden away from the crowd, struggles to cut the rope, but, after a few tries, he finally does. Cut to the food stands. The groundskeepers reflect on what went on)

Rigby: That went pretty well.

Benson: Are you kidding?!

Mordecai: You can't fire me. I thought of the marker thing.

Rigby: Yeah. We totally saved you this time, Benson.

Benson: (growls) Quick! Maellard's coming!

(Turns Pops around as Mr. Maellard walks up to him for a congratulation)

Mr. Maellard: Son, you gave a fine speech up there. I'm so... proud of you.

Pops: Oh! Thank you, papa! (Is seen crying on his defaced side) Thank you.

Mr. Maellard: You pulled it together out there today, Ball bucket. Good job. (walks away)

Benson: Thank you, sir. It was.... no trouble.

Mordecai and Rigby: What was that?

Mordecai: We're the ones that found Pops.

Benson: And sent him into shock and desecrated his face! (sighs) Let's go clean you up, Pops. (He, Pops, and Skips leave)

Mordecai: This party sucks.

Rigby: You wanna go back to that Dizzy World?

Mordecai: Yes.

Mordecai: Dude, hurry up! Tie it down, we're gonna be late!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump inside the golf-cart and drive off. A car stops)

Rigby: Go, Go, Go! Take that street! (they make a sharp turn)

Mordecai: We're not gonna make it, we're not gonna make it!

(Meanwhile, Benson and Skips are standing around at the park. Benson checks his watch)

Benson: I knew it. I knew they'd be late.

Mordecai: This is gonna be close.

(Benson and Skips watch over the hill for Mordecai and Rigby, but they're not coming)

Benson: That's it.

(Benson and Skips approach the cart before M&R suddenly come up driving)

Mordecai: (gasps) Dude, we made it! Dude, we made it! (M&R suddenly hit a rock, sending them out of control. They hit a lamppost, which the tree is lodged into. Mordecai tries to get it out, but the leaves fall out. M&R pick up the broken tree anyway and show it to Benson and Skips) Here's the lemon tree you asked us to pick up.

Rigby: Right on time. (Benson watches the sole lemon fall off the tree) I think the guy sold us a lemon, know what I'm sayin'?

(M&R snicker. Benson turns red, growls at them, upset and angry that they failed their job, and he's about to yell, but quickly calms down)

Benson: No. You know what? I blame myself. I should've known better than to trust you two morons with such a straightforward task. You obviously need supervision.

Mordecai: (confused) Super-what-now?

Benson: (picks up walkie-talkie on the golf cart) Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, get down here. I need you to watch over Mordecai and Rigby.

Muscle Man: (over microphone) We'll be right there.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: No way! (drops the part of the tree he has onto the ground in anger after hearing their names) You can't stick us with Muscle Man and Hi Five. Those guys are turds!

Mordecai: They have the combined intelligence of bread-mold. Come on, Benson. Give us one more chance.

Benson: No more chances. I'm sending you to the nursery to pick up another lemon tree. If you screw up again, I'll have Muscle Man and Hi Five supervise the next job. Then the next job, and the next. (turns red) Get it?!

Mordecai: Yes. Um, yes, sir.

Benson: I'm sure.

(Benson drives the cart as he and Skips leave)

Rigby: Aw, man!

Mordecai: Ugh, this blows. You know what the worst is?

Rigby: The smell?

Mordecai: No, dude. Those lame "my mom" jokes Muscle Man always tells.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost drive up from over the hill)

Muscle Man: WHOOOOO!!!

Mordecai: Great.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost drive in)

Muscle Man: Well, well, well. Sounds like someone needs some supervision. You know who else needs supervision? MY MOM! Haha, yeah! (Muscle Man & Hi Five Ghost hi five each other) Now get in the back so I can supervise you.

(M&R, MM & Hi Five Ghost are now in the golf cart together. Loud music blares)

Muscle Man: WHOOOOO!!! Oh, yeah. This song rocks. You know who else rocks this hard? MY MOM!

Rigby: I don't know how long I can take this.

Mordecai: I know dude but if we don't pull this off...

Rigby: Aw, sick.

(Muscle Man's crack is seen)

Muscle Man: I love this tasty lick!

Rigby: That's it! I'm jumping!

Mordecai: No, dude. Don't worry. There's the nursery. This will all be over soon. (Cart passes the nursery) Whoa! Dude! (looks back at the nursery) You just passed the nursery!

Muscle Man: Pull your panties out of your butt, bro. I know a shortcut.

Mordecai: But it was right there!

Muscle Man: Who's supervising this mission? ME, that's who! So, shut your word-hole, I'm listening to my jams.

(Cart stops in the middle of a forest)

Mordecai: What? Where are we? Why are we stopping?

Muscle Man: It's lunchtime, (points to taco stand) This place has the best tacos in the city. (chuckles) You know who else has the best tacos in the city?

Rigby: Dude, Benson will blow a fuse if he finds out we were slacking off.

Muscle Man: You know who else would blow a fuse if she found out we were slacking off?

Mordecai: We don't have time for this.

Muscle Man: You know who else doesn't have time for this?

Mordecai and Rigby: UGH!!

Muscle Man: You know who else says "Ugh"? MY MOM! Hyah! (MM & Hi Five Ghost hi five again)

Mordecai: Can we please get lunch after we pick up the tree?

Muscle Man: No can do. Hi Fives has gots to have his tacos. Watch this. (picks up walkie-talkie) Hey, Benson, we're gonna pull over and grab some lunch. That cool?

Benson: (over microphone) Go for it. I know you guys will get it done.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Rigby: Benson is never that cool with us!

Muscle Man: What? Don't you guys check in?

Mordecai: Uh, no.

Muscle Man: You gotta check in. Benson's the boss. He needs to know where you are at all times. WHOOOOO, LET'S EAT!

Rigby: How come you never check in? (Mordecai pushes Rigby away)

Taco Guy: Muscle Man! H.F.G.! (Taco Guy hi fives Hi Five Ghost) I haven't seen you guys in ages. Who are those losers? (M&R stand there)

Muscle Man: Just some chumps I'm supervising. I gotta make sure they're doing it right.

Taco Guy: I feel sorry for you guys.

Muscle Man: You know who I feel sorry for? MY MOM!

Taco Guy, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost: OHHHHH! (Muscle Man shakes the stand)

Rigby: OHHH! (Mordecai punches him) Ow!

(MM, Hi Five Ghost and the Taco Guy laugh)

Taco Guy: Here's a round of tacos for makin' me laugh.

(Taco Guy hi fives Muscle Man)

Mordecai: Aw, what? You actually thought that was funny?

Rigby: I guess Muscle Man is really insulting himself.

(clock transition to the forest, moments later. Muscle Man is drinking a soda)

Mordecai: It's getting late. Shouldn't we be at the nursery by now?

Muscle Man: (Stops drinking his beverage) Relax, Hi Fives is on it. (Hi Five Ghost opens the engine cover) He knows how to hot-wire the cart, to make it go crazy-fast. You know who taught Hi Fives to hot-wire the cart to get away with slacking off at work and not get in trouble with his boss? (pauses) My uncle, John. He's a mechanic.

Rigby: ...That's cool.

Muscle Man: You know who taught him? MY MOM! YES! (MM&Hi Five Ghost hi five each other a third time. M&R look at each other and get on the cart) Let's ride, babies!

(Later, they're all in the cart together as Muscle Man disobeys a railroad sign and jumps right over a moving train)

Mordecai: The road's back there!

Muscle Man: Don't tell me where the road is, baby. (drives into puddle, over a rocky road, runs over traffic cones and jumps the car again)

Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Rigby: WHOOOOO!

(they pass a police car. The cop watches. The golf cart is reflected on his sunglasses. He drives up to the golf cart)

Police Officer: Yo, Muscle Man! You know how to break the law in all the right ways!

Police Officer and Muscle Man: (hi five) WHOOOOO! WHOOOOO!

Mordecai: What was that?

Rigby: This is awesome!

(the cart stops at the nursery)

Muscle Man: We're here. (clock transition to M&R lifting up a lemon tree inside the nursery) What are you doing? You're trying to throw your backs out? You don't lift it like that. That's what Bobby's for. Hey, yo, Bobby! (Bobby appears) Bobby here lifts like a champ. (short silence) Hey Bobby, you know who else lifts like a champ? MY MOM! (Bobby laughs, hi fives Muscle Man and picks up the tree)

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Dude, I think Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are actually kinda cool.

Muscle Man: Lift with the legs, Bobby! The legs! Like my mom!

Bobby: (laughing) You killing me, man!

Mordecai: Yeah, I don't know about that. (cut to the road) Well, I'm glad this is finally over.

Rigby: Come on, it wasn't--

(Mordecai looks back)

Mordecai: Dude! You just passed the park!

Muscle Man: What's the hurry, grandma? We have all day, let's have some fun.

Mordecai: Ugh!

Rigby: Come on, dude, just give him a chance.

(begin a montage set to the song "Nothing But a Good Time" by Poison. It starts at the arcade, where Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Rigby play Giganto-Fist. Muscle Man looks over at Mordecai, and shows him a quarter. He inserts it into the machine, which attracts Mordecai to play. Next is at the movie theater. The slime monster reaches out for the girl in the red dress. The crowd is shown, all wearing 3D glasses. Muscle Man gives Mordecai some popcorn, which he eats. Third up is at a bowling alley. Hi Five Ghost bowls a strike, and the gang all cheers for him. Muscle Man and Mordecai hi five each other several times, followed by one final four-way hi five. The montage ends with Muscle Man driving the golf cart)

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man's pretty cool. All except for those "my mom" jokes. Dude, I'm gonna to say something.

Rigby: No, don't! Don't try to change Muscle Man, it's not cool!

Muscle Man: Hey, guys. I haven't had quality bro time like this in ages. We should do this all the time. I know I mess around a lot, but you guys are the best. (pause) Hey, Mordecai, you know who else messes around a lot? (Mordecai frowns. In slow motion, Muscle Man says it:) MY MOM! (laughs)

(Mordecai, annoyed, by yet another "my mom" joke, finally having enough.)

Mordecai: (angry) Dude, you're saying it wrong.

Rigby: Mordecai!

Muscle Man: (confused) What was that, bro?

Mordecai: Muscle Man, that joke doesn't make any sense. Whenever you say stuff like that, you're making fun of your own mom. (Hi Five Ghost starts freaking out) It should be "your mom", not "my mom".

Muscle Man: (reflects in mirror; confused) What do you mean?

Mordecai: Well, for example, you know who else has a gap in their teeth? YOUR MOM! (A distressed, Hi Five Ghost tries to stop him; only to be ignored by Mordecai) Or, you know who else is prematurely balding? YOUR MOM! Rigby, help me out.

Rigby: (thinks) You know who else finds their clothes in the garbage? YOUR MOM!

Mordecai: You know who else lives in their car? YOUR MOM! (Muscle Man looks around, visibly frustrated, starts fuming)

Rigby: You know who else has fat ankles? YOUR MOM!

Mordecai: You know who else can't tell a--

Muscle Man: (furious) AAAUUUGGGHHH! (brakes) Are you making fun of my mom?! You're making fun of my mom! No one makes fun of my mom!

Muscle Bro (John): (over microphone) Yo, little brother! My ears are ringing! Is someone making fun of our mom?

Muscle Man: Yeah, they are, bro.

Muscle Bro: (over microphone) Oh no, bro!

Muscle Man: I know, bro!

Muscle Bro: (over microphone) That's it! I'm coming up there! (M&R get scared)

Muscle Man: You ladies are about to wish you were never born! GET OUT OF THE CART! (M&R do so) You're gonna get it! Nobody makes fun of my mom! Nobody! (he huffs and puffs. Then, all of a sudden, the ground splits. A burning truck emerges from the ground. Muscle Bro steps out)

Muscle Bro: Which one of you girls was talking about my mom? (points at Rigby) Was it you, Tiny? (knocks him over and goes to Mordecai) Or you, string-bean? (pushes him, too)

Mordecai: We were just--

Muscle Bro: So it was both of you!

Muscle Man: I think they hurt mom's feelings, bro.

Muscle Bro: You hurt our mom's feelings. (lifts up a picture) Pay her a compliment, tell her she's beautiful. TELL HER!

Mordecai: (shakes in fear and horror) Uh, you're beautiful, Muscle Man's mom.

Muscle Man: Now, kiss the photo and tell her you're sorry. (John holds photo to Mordecai's face)

Mordecai: Sorry. (kisses photo)

Rigby: (kisses photo) Sorry...

Muscle Man: Fire up the grill, bro. (John puts a grill on the ground, lights it ablaze, and Muscle Man comes up to put the photo on the grill. John flips it, and then hands it to Muscle Man) Eat this picture of our mom, or you'll be sorry!

Mordecai: Please, don't make us eat the picture...

Muscle Man and Muscle Bro: EAT IT!

(Muscle Man rips the photo in half, then hands the halves to M&R. Shaken by the wrath of two muscle bros, Rigby bites into his half first, then Mordecai. Muscle Man and John laugh at them)

Muscle Bro: You should have seen the look on your faces!

Muscle Man: We got you good!

Mordecai: What?

Muscle Man: It was all a prank and you chumps fell for it! (they hi five each other and laugh once again. Hi Five Ghost comes out of the bushes to hi five Muscle Man) That's not even a picture of my mom, (M&R put the two halves together) It's a picture of my butt cheek! I just squished it up to look like a woman's face.

Mordecai: (as M&R are disgusted) Aw, sick!

Muscle Man: Are you still hungry? Cause I got multiple prints. That's right. I dabble in photography. (MM & Hi Five Ghost, as well as John, three-way hi five. Clock transition to the park)

Benson: Thanks for picking up this tree. I knew I could trust you two. (to M&R) As for you two, next time I ask you to do something, do it right or I'll have them supervise you again. Got it? (Benson and Skips walk off)

Muscle Man: You know who else is going to have to get supervised again for not doing it right? (He's seen twirling his shirt around while on top of the cart) MY MOM! (Hi Five Ghost starts driving the cart around) WHOOOOO! Later, ladies! (they drive off, leaving M&R incredibly furious)

Mordecai: (annoyed) I really hate Muscle Man.

Rigby: (also annoyed) You know who else really hates Muscle Man?

Mordecai: [groans] What now? Look, we're working. See.

Rigby: Yeah, we're never gonna get done if you keep checking up on us.

Benson: It's Pay day, fellas.

[Mordecai and Rigby run towards Benson]

Mordecai: Yeah-yuh!

Rigby: My favorite day of the every other week!

Benson: [hands Mordecai and Rigby each a bag of change] Here. [Mordecai groans] What, you don't like getting paid?

Mordecai: No, I'm just getting tired of the old sandwich-baggie full of coins. Why can't we get a check like normal people? Skips gets checks.

Benson: Skips has a bank account and a 401k.

Mordecai: Well, at least give us the coins in an envelope or something more respectable, 'cause this is degrading. [Benson drives away] I need to get out of here. [Cut to Mordecai and Rigby walking to the coffee shop] What's his deal? He doesn't respect us at all!

Rigby: Yeah, well that's his problem, right? We're respectable people.

[Mordecai and Rigby get knocked over by two skateboarders]

Kid 1: Outta the way!

Kid 2: Losers!

[Mordecai and Rigby shake their fists]

Mordecai: What the heck, man? Watch it! [Cut to the coffee shop] See man, it's not just Benson, people just don't respect us.

Rigby: Well, we could buy people's respect.

Mordecai: Nah, too expensive. People respect people who are good at things. [Pan to crowd cheering around an arcade game. Mordecai and Rigby walk up to Margaret] Margaret, what's going on?

Margaret: The manager installed this new arcade game to keep the customers around. These kids are amazing at it, you should see 'em.

[Mordecai looks and sees that the kids are the skateboarders from before]

Mordecai: Dude, it's those kids! (to the kids) Hey, hey you!

Kid 2: What?

Mordecai: When you knock people over, you have to say you're sorry. You guys need to learn some respect.

Kid 1: Respect our butts.

Rigby: No, you respect our butts!

Margaret: What are you guys doing?

Mordecai: Those kids practically killed us with their skateboards outside.

Margaret: So? They're kids. What are you going to do, beat them up or something?

Mordecai: No, but I am gonna kick their butts at this video game. [puts coin on the arcade game] Bam! I got next.

Kid 2: Nice baggie, must've been sad when you break open your piggy bank.

[The kids laugh]

Kids: Seven-hundred thousand/700,0000!

Kid 2: [putting name on high score list] TRD, turd. [laughs] Nice.

Kids: [high-five] Yeah-yuh!

Kid 2: Beat that, gramps.

Mordecai: Gramps? I'm in my 20s.

Kid 1: Yeah, 1920s. [laughs]

Mordecai: Just move. [sits in front of the arcade game, cracks knuckles and starts playing]

[Cut to Rigby and Mordecai sitting down at a table]

Rigby: How do you get negative points? How is that even possible?

Mordecai: It was the first time I ever played that stupid game. Give me a break.

Rigby: I'm just saying, you made us look like chumps, man.

Mordecai: Look at 'em.

[Pan to the kids being praised by the manager]

Manager: You guys really handed it to those losers.

Margaret: [walks over with plate of donuts] Free donuts for the champs!

[Kids eat donuts, crowd cheers]

Kid 2: All right, we're outta here.

[Kids exit, crowd speaks of amazement]

Margaret: [walking away] Weren't they amazing? I can't believe we were so enthralled by a video game, but we were.

Mordecai: I told you people respect you when you're good at something. And we're gonna get the respect we deserve by getting good at that game. [Mordecai and Rigby start playing the game] Okay, Broken Bonez.

Rigby: So are you trying to get broken bones?

Mordecai: Dude, c'mon, no, you just gotta go off these jumps and land without breaking your bones.

[Motorcyclist in game lands for 10 points]

Rigby: Alright, I think I got it. Here, gimme a shot. [mindlessly taps and turns]

[Motorcyclist does a trick and lands for 500 points]

Mordecai: Woah, how'd you do that?

Rigby: I dunno, that's what those kids were doing. Here, you do the joystick and I'll do the buttons. Just go crazy when we're in the air.

[Mordecai and Rigby tap and turn wildly, sound goes off]

Mordecai: Wow, another 500! Aww sweet!

Jack Farley: Aww, well not bad, not bad. You guys got some skill.

Mordecai: Some? What do you mean some?

[Jack Farley plays the game, Mordecai and Rigby play the game, Jack Farley plays the game again]

Jack Farley: C'mon, Jack Farley! [groans] Dang it! [Screen shows 5 broken bonez!] Well, I gotta hand it to you guys. You play better than you look.

Rigby: Okay?

Mordecai: Thanks.

Jack Farley: Stop by the office sometime if you wanna hang. [hands Mordecai a card] No charge. [cellphone rings] Yeah, Jack Farley? No! I said cell two, two!

Rigby: What was that all about?

[Pan to card, says 'Jack Farley thinks you're awesome' on it]

Mordecai: [gasps] Respect!

Rigby: Let's get some more.

Benson: (over walkie talkie) Mordecai, Rigby, come in.

Mordecai: Aww, man, it's Benson. [reaches for walkie talkie] Yeah, uh, hey Benson. What's up?

Benson: (over walkie talkie) I need you guys to clean the bathrooms back at the house ASAP.

Mordecai: Uh, we're on our lunch break.

Benson: Look, if you guys aren't back in two minutes, you're fired!

Rigby: Gimme that! [snatches walkie talkie] We deserve more respect than this, Benson. Maybe when you realize that we'll come back to work. [throws wakie talkie in the bin]

Benson: (over walkie talkie) Rigby, Mordecai!

Mordecai and Rigby: Respect!

[Montage of Mordecai and Rigby versing people at Broken Bonez and gaining respect. Cut to the kids watching them play]

Kid 1: Oh look, if it isn't Mr. and Mrs. negative points. Guess we'll have to beat you two losers again.

Mordecai: Well, why don't you two come over here and try, then?

Kid 2: You got yourselves a rematch.

[Mordecai and Rigby verse the kids and win]

Kids: Aww, man!

Kid 2: All right, you guys are good.

Mordecai: Thanks.

Kid 1: Whoa, you guys are really good! You're close to beating the high score!

Mordecai: Whoa, we are?

[Mordecai and Rigby's score: 950,000. High score: 1,275,640]

Jack Farley: Wait, who holds the high score?

Dude: Some dude named GBF, but it's not just a high score, it's the world record.

Jack Farley: Thanks, now I can follow along and feel invested. Go for it, guys!

[Mordecai and Rigby top the high score with a new score of 1,279,000.]

Mordecai: Yeah!

[Everyone cheers. Margaret runs up and hugs Mordecai. The ground starts to shake and a beam from a lightning cloud shoots into the café. A giant head, GBF, appears]

GBF: So you've broken the world record, have you?

Mordecai: Yeah, who's asking?

GBF: Me. [turns around]

[Crowd gasps]

Rigby: [makes sound of disgust] It's a giant bearded face!

Mordecai & Rigby: [gasp] GBF!

GBF: Yeah, I'm GBF all right, but it stands for Garrett Bobby Ferguson, not Giant Bearded Face.

Rigby: You're not mad at us for breaking your world record, are you?

GBF: It's no big deal. Not like it's the universe record or anything important.

Mordecai & Rigby: The Universe record?

GBF: It's the highest score in the whole universe, 1,279,001. Now who holds that record again? Oh yeah, me! [Crowd runs up to GBF and strokes his beard] Yes, go ahead, stroke the beard of Garrett Bobby Ferguson.

Mordecai: Hey, Giant Beard-o Face!

GBF: I told you that's not my name!

Mordecai: Look, we're gonna settle this right now. Us versus you in a head to head match.

GBF: Fine. One game for the universe record. Winner gets all the respect. [sprouts arms and legs] [Mordecai and Rigby make a sound of disgust] Let's play.

[Mordecai and Rigby versus GBF. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby in the lead and GBF crying]

Mordecai: Dude, why're you crying, dude?

GBF: Please, please just let me win.

Mordecai: Dude, what are you talking about?

GBF: I've devoted my entire life to Broken Bonez. I played so much my wife left me.

[Crowd murmur in sympathy]

Mordecai: So you're asking us to throw the game?

GBF: Please, the universe record is all I have.

Mordecai: What do you think, man?

Rigby: No way! Nobody's gonna respect us if we wuss out now.

[GBF cries harder, the crowd murmurs in sympathy more]

Mordecai: It's not wussing out, man. It's called doing the right thing.

Rigby: Fine.

Mordecai: Okay dude, we'll let you have it.

[Mordecai and Rigby let go, screen shows 'Player 1: 1,250,000']

GBF: Thank you so much! [laughs evilly] Thank you for being so dumb.

Mordecai & Rigby: What?

GBF: I didn't devote my life to this cruddy game, it's just a hobby.

Mordecai: But what about your wife?

GBF: [scoffs] Never had one. You can't tie GBF down.

Rigby: You can't do that, that's cheating!

GBF: Universe rules, baby. There are no rules. [Crowd boo] Oh, boo yourselves! I'm Garrett Bobby Ferguson.

Mordecai: Aww, this blows! We gotta do something before he beats our score.

Rigby: No rules, right? Mess up, c'mon, mess up!

Mordecai: You know you want some broken bones.

Rigby: Broken bones!

Mordecai & Rigby: Broken bones!

[Crowd starts chanting 'broken bones'. GBF beats their score]

GBF: [laughs] It doesn't matter, I've already beat your score and taken the title and I'm never coming back.

[Game makes a noise]

Jack Farley: Wait, the game's still going!

Mordecai: Huh?

[Mordecai and Rigby start playing]

GBF: No, it can't be!

Mordecai: C'mon, c'mon!

[GBF starts throwing Mordecai and Rigby away from the game. He pulls on Mordecai]

Mordecai: Get off!

[Rigby bites him in the shin, Mordecai kicks him in the groin']

GBF: Ow! My Chin!

[Mordecai and Rigby furiously play. Score shows 1,300,000]

Mordecai & Rigby: Yeah!

GBF: NOOOOOOOOO-- [explodes and covers everyone in a white brain goo]

[Crowd cheers and surrounds Mordecai and Rigby]

Jack Farley: Great job, you did it!

[Crowd leaves, reveals Benson]

Mordecai: Oh, hey Benson, what're you doing here?

Benson: I thought about what you guys said earlier and so I've come down to give you those checks you wanted.

Mordecai & Rigby: Oh, wow, thanks. [reach for the checks]

Benson: [pulls checks away] But now that I'm covered in brain goo, I've realized my mistake. (goes red) [starts tearing up checks] You wanna waste your lives playing video games, then fine! I respect your decision! Just don't ever do it on my time ever again!

Mordecai: I can respect that.

Rigby: Yeah, that's cool.

Rigby: Alright, Level 10! We better not lose this time.

Mordecai: Dude, quit messing around and we'll beat it.

Rigby: Last time wasn't my fault.

Mordecai: Whatever, just take it seriously.

Both: Triple thugs! Triple thugs! Beat them up! (Does so while saying "triple thugs")

(POW! POW! (500) POW! After defeating the Triple Thugs, a burly pink monster-like man comes across the characters in the game and roars)

Rigby: Oh no, not this guy! We never beat this guy!

Mordecai: Dude, we're gonna do it this time. Come on, hit him! Hit him!

Rigby: I am hitting him, nothing's happening!

Mordecai: Aw, dude! Try kicking him in the junk! Kick him in the junk! Kick him in the junk!

Rigby: I'm kicking him in the junk!

Mordecai: Well, keep doing it!

(KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK! BEEP! (1200) The monster is defeated)

Mordecai and Rigby: Oooooooohhhh!

Mordecai: I told you we were gonna do it. I told you!

Rigby: I knew we were gonna make it.

Mordecai: Yeah, right. That's not what you said 20 hours ago when you were whining about how hard the game was.

Rigby: *Gasps* Look! We made it to the final level!

Mordecai: Dude, do you know what this means?

Rigby: We're dead?

Mordecai: No, we have to beat The Hammer.

Rigby: What was the slogan of this game again, "Nobody Beats The Hammer"?

Mordecai: Yeah, right. More like nobody has even seen The Hammer.

Rigby: Well, get ready to live. He's probably gonna come out of those doors.

[(BUST!...) Goes the brick wall. Out comes The Hammer.]

The Hammer: Nobody beats The Hammer.

Rigby: It's The Hammer! (Mordecai and Rigby jump off he couch) Hit 'im! Hit 'im!

(KICK! KICK! KICK! KICK! Nothing happens)

Mordecai: Man, our hits aren't doing anything!

Rigby: I know, my thumbs are killing me!

(KICK! KICK! Nothing still happens) 

(BAM! BEEP! BAM! BEEP! The Hammer punches both characters. It take both of their lives with ease.)

Mordecai: Just one of his hits takes a whole life!

(BAM! BAM! BEEP! The Hammer flings Mordecai's character onto Rigby's and and then lands on them. Both characters' second life is taken away at the same time. One more life gone, then game over for them.)

Mordecai: *Gasps* Run away, dude, run away!

(Their characters run away from The Hammer while he chases them in circles.)

Rigby: Don't let him touch you, man!

Mordecai: I'm not, I'm not! (his character is cornered by The Hammer) AHH! RIGBY, HELP ME!

(Rigby's character grabs a chair and slams it against the back of The Hammer)

Rigby: YEAHHH!

The Hammer: Arrrrgh!

[The Hammer's life decreases a little.....]

Mordecai: Dude, his weakness is furniture! Furni-

[The TV suddenly flicks off]

Mordecai: What just happened? (runs to the TV to quickly turn it back on)

Rigby: I don't know! (picks up the remote while panicking)

Mordecai: (moves the TV onto the side, and then slams the top of it to make the picture appear for about a second, and then it flicks off again.) Oh! Dude, the game's still on! Pause it, dude, pause it!

Rigby: ( presses a button) It's paused!

Mordecai: Aww, Man! (While slamming the TV) Come on! Come on! (stops slamming) Rigby, you finish him off.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Dude, we figured out his weakness, I'll keep the TV on while you beat The Hammer.

Rigby: Alright, let's do it!

Mordecai: Ready....Go! (starts drumming onto TV to keep the picture on)

(Rigby's character attempts to fight off the Hammer, but it proves too much for him to beat all by himself.)

Rigby: (grunting and freaking out) EEEAAAARRRGH!... I can't do it!... (pauses the game again as his character's life has decreased heavily from he hammer's single punch.)

Mordecai: Awww, man! We were totally gonna beat it.

Rigby: (sighs) I know. He's just too hard to beat alone.

Mordecai: Argh....dude, we gotta find another TV...

(Mordecai and Rigby go off to see Skips)

Skips: The Hammer? Nobody gets to The Hammer. But even if you did, I don't have a TV.

Mordecai and Rigby: Argh!

Skips: What's wrong with the TV in the house?

Mordecai: I don't know, it's broken.

Rigby: Yeah, the screen doesn't work.

Mordecai: Yeah. Come on, Skips, you gotta have some mystical solution or some weird thing we could use for how we could get another TV.

Skips: Hmm... Did you ask Pops?

(Mordecai and Rigby go back into the house to see Pops)

Pops: Ooooooh! The Hammer, how exciting, is he a mallet or a gavel? (laughs)

Mordecai: Pops seriously, can we borrow your TV?

Pops: Of course.

Mordecai and Rigby: Yes!

Pops: Here she is. (Pops brings them his radio instead and places it on the floor)

Mordecai: Pops, that's a radio.

Pops: It's a TV if you close your eyes. (He then switches on his radio and closes his eyes) Now hook up your game so you can defeat The Hammer. (laugh)

Rigby: We don't have time for this...

Mordecai: Rock, Paper, Scissors for who has to ask Muscle Man for his TV?

Mordecai and Rigby proceed with the short game with Rigby choosing Rock over Mordecai's Scissors

Mordecai: (knowing that's he has to do it) Argh...

Rigby: Hmm, Hmm!

Mordecai: Come on, Rigby, let's go get a real TV.

Pops: Wait! I want to see The Hammer too! (follows Mordecai and Rigby out the room)

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops make their way to Muscle Man's trailer. Mordecai knocks on his door.)

Muscle Man: (From behind the door) Who is it?

Mordecai: It's us.

Muscle Man: What do you want?

Mordecai: We wanna borrow your TV.

Muscle Man: Why?

Mordecai: Because... we're about to beat The Hammer.

Muscle Man: WHAT? (he opens the door) NOBODY can't beat The Hammer, It's impossible.

Mordecai: Pft. Not for us. Are you gonna let us borrow your TV or not?

Muscle Man: Yeah, you can borrow it, if you can tell me what The Hammer looks like.

Mordecai: He's blue. With a black mullet.

Muscle Man: Fives.

(Hi Five Ghost looks in the video game manual and sees that the character matches the description.)

Hi Five Ghost: Uh, huh.

Muscle Man: Oh, man!

Rigby: So can we borrow it?

Muscle Man: Yeah, you can borrow it, so we can watch you lose. Hahaha! Whoo, whoo! (runs back in to pick his TV up from the floor but without knowing that it is still plugged in) This is gonna be hilari- oh!

(The TV then smashes onto the ground.)

Rigby: (after a moment of silence) Does Benson have a TV?

(The group then travel to Benson's apartment. Mordecai knocks on his door.)

Rigby: Tell him we need it.

Mordecai: Shh!

Muscle Man: Yeah, tell him we need it to see you lose.

Mordecai: SHUT UP! (he and Muscle Man wrestle a bit until Benson comes out)

Mordecai: Oh, hey, Benson.

Rigby: Tell him we need it. (he then gets slapped by Mordecai)

Benson: What is it?

Mordecai: Oh, uh, we were just in the neighborhood-

Benson: Cut to the chase, I am busy.

Mordecai: Can we borrow your TV?

Benson: Hehe... No. (proceeds to close the door on them but is then blocked by Muscle Man and Rigby)

Muscle Man: No, wait!

Rigby: Benson, please! We're about to beat The Hammer! We neeeed it!

Benson: Yeah, The Hammer. When you say that, I think hammer and nails, but you couldn't possibly be talking about work.

Mordecai: It's a video game.

Benson: Oh. right, right, it's a video game.

Mordecai: Yeah, it's a video game.

Rigby: Yeah, so can we borrow your TV?

Benson: No.

Everyone: Awww, come on, please... (but Benson closes the door on them)

Mordecai: Argh... (Rigby kicks Benson's door and the light switches off above them)

Pops: Look! There's TVs on Benson's TV!

They look through the window revealing the inside of Benson's apartment, to see an advertisement of the TV Store Warehouse, who are selling TVs....literally free. Benson is seen here, sitting on the couch watching it too.

Man 1: (On TV): TV Store Warehouse! We've got TVs!

Man 2: Too many TVs! Take your pick! We're practically giving them away! No, wait! We're literally giving them away!

Man 1: We're literally giving TVs away!

Both: LITERALLY!

Man 1: And the other TVs are really cheap!

Man 2: Yeah, so those ones were practically literally giving away for free too!

Both: LITERALLY!

Man 1: You better be a truck with a big box in it, 'cause we're just throwing 'em away!

Man 2::Yeah, TVs are trash to us, and so are you...

Both: ...AT THE TV STORE WAREHOUSE!

Mordecai: Does anybody know how far that place is from here?

Muscle Man: Not far. I got a buddy who works there.

Mordecai: Let's do it.

(The group then drives on to the TV Store Warehouse)

Mordecai: (Inside the warehouse) We want one of those flat screens from the commercial.

Jimmy: The flat screens are full-price.

(The guys are shocked.)

Rigby: What? But your commercial said you were giving away free TVs.

Muscle Man: Come on, Jimmy, you gotta have something.

Jimmy: Sorry, dude, there's nothing I can do, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: Jimmy.....come on, Jimmy......you know you owe me and besides, this is worth it. These guys made it all the way to The Hammer, AND I WANNA SEE 'EM LOSE!

Jimmy: Whoa, are you serious? (Looks around) Okay, look, I might have something, but don't tell anyone...

They follow Jimmy around the back and see an old ordinary TV on the ground.)

Muscle Man: What is that?

Jimmy: It's a TV.

Mordecai: Does it even turn on?

Jimmy: Yeah.....(switches the TV on, but the screen is in grayscale)

Rigby: What? It's not even in color! Lame.

(The group is not satisfied with the model and they loudly complain.)

Jimmy: Look, you guys wanted a TV for free, This is your free TV.

Mordecai: How much for your cheapest flat screen?

Jimmy: $1,200.

(Knowing that they can't afford it, the group take the free TV with them back home. Mordecai places it near the TV they usually use.)

Rigby: Make sure the game's still paused.

(Mordecai slams onto their TV, revealing The Hammer)

Muscle Man: Whoa! You really did get to The Hammer!

Rigby: Yeah. That's what we've been saying the whole time.

Muscle Man: I thought you were lying.

Rigby: Why would we do that?

Muscle Man: Cause you're not good enough at anything to get to The Hammer, This is just a fluke! (he shoves Rigby)

Rigby: (shoves Muscle Man back) You're the fluke!

They start to wrestle until Mordecai interrupts them

Mordecai: Guys, stop! stop!! We've got a problem. This thing doesn't have the right hook-ups.

Rigby: What? Well, what does it have?

Mordecai: I don't know! It's like a weird...thing, but it doesn't match this other thing, plus, it doesn't even plug in. I mean, look at this!

[Mordecai shows them the strange looking plug.]

Rigby: What kind of plug is that?

Muscle Man: Forget this, man. You guys aren't even gonna beat The Hammer anyway. Just turn it off. (he proceeds to turn the video game console off but Mordecai stops him)

Mordecai: No! We can't just give up. I wanna beat this thing. We may never get this far in the game again. Now, come on, will you please just help us? Please help us? (his attention is actually on the TV instead of the others, Muscle Man puts his hand on his shoulder to assure him that they will help out)

Muscle Man: Let us try...bro.

(Muscle Man rips the cord from his smashed TV back at his caravan home and returns with it while Rigby and Pops visit Skips asking for his aid, he's reluctant but is willing to help them out. Muscle Man connects his TV cord while Skips breaks Pops' radio to bring out the speakers and places both on either side of the TV. He even plugs in the small hook-up.)

Mordecai: Keep your fingers crossed. (he looks around Rigby and switches on the TV, which then works, despite being grayscale, The others are happy about it. They cheer.).

Mordecai: (Looks at Rigby, they both have the controllers in their hands) Ready?

Rigby: Ready.

[They start the game while the others cheer them on....until everything in town starts to switch off.....soon their TV as well as their console fuse together to become the character in their video game....The Hammer.]

Everyone: Whoa....

Muscle Man: It's The Hammer! (He runs to go near him) He's real!

(The Hammer looks questionably at him)

Muscle Man: Dudes, take my picture with- (He gets knocked out by The Hammer) Oh no, br-- (The Hammer squashes him with his leg)

[The fight begins when The Hammer breaks the couch in half causing the others to run, Skips remains standing ready to face but he gets knocked over easily to the side onto the wall.]

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!!

[Skips spits after being knocked over and roars as he tries an ineffective shoulder charge. One by one they all try to combat him, but he proves to be too much of a challenge for them. He easily beats the group with a single punch, kick, squash, smashing them to the wall, even jacking Pops up in the face with a wood plank. Then, The Hammer creates a powerful ball of energy ready to aim it at them.]

Rigby: That doesn't look good...

Mordecai: What's he doing...?

Skips: Everybody get down!

They all proceed to take over cover and unexpectedly Muscle Man's friend, Jimmy, comes into the house.

Jimmy: Yo, Muscle Man, my boss found out that I gave you guys that TV and he fired me. Is it cool if I crash here for a couple da—what the--? (he's stunned to see The Hammer in view and then he is blasted away by the energy ball while screaming, and which kills him instantly by explosive)

Skips: How are we supposed to hurt him?

Mordecai: I don't know. He was invincible in the game too until we hit him with...*gasps* furniture! Everybody quick! Grab whatever you can and smash it on him!

(So they all grab as many furniture items around the room and one by one, they proceed to hit The Hammer. Soon, The Hammer starts to weaken after taking in so many hits.)

Mordecai: Dude, he's almost dead!

Skips: Quick! Find something else!

[They look around for an item to deliver the last blow but most of the furniture items have already been used.]

Rigby: There's no more furniture!

]The Hammer then targets Skips and chases after him.]

Rigby: Skips, his legs! Watch out for his legs!

[Skips sees that the Hammer is about to attack him until Mordecai spots an unused chair in the room.]

Mordecai: Skips, catch! (he throws the chair in his direction and Skips guards himself with it. The Hammer gets hit in the groin area and falls to the floor)

Skips: The control pads! Grab the control pads!

(Mordecai and Rigby run towards The Hammer to take hold of his hands which are the control pads while the others hold onto both of his legs. The Hammer tries to break free, but he remains restrained and his face transits to the video game in color.)

Mordecai and Rigby: *gasp* The game!

Skips: Play it!!!

(Mordecai and Rigby finish off the game, hitting The Hammer with chairs and gain an easy win with the words "YOU WIN" in the screen. Then, The TV falls then breaks and the power comes back on. Everyone gathers together, to celebrate their victory on defeating The Hammer)

Mordecai: Yeah! we did it!

They look over to hear the door opening and Benson comes through with his TV.

Benson: Hey, guys. There was a blackout at my place, so I figured tha- (he is shocked to find the house in a mess and without saying another word, he leaves)

Mordecai: Dude. Quit messing around and give me a hand with these boxes.

Rigby: I'm busy.

(Rigby swipes at the moth but misses, hitting an old box covered with a tarp. Dust clouds fly into the air as Rigby coughs.)

Rigby: Huh? (The tarp falls off the box, uncovering a mini-fridge filled with soda. He gasps.)

Mordecai: What? What is it?

(Rigby stares open-mouthed at the contents of the box.)

Mordecai: (gasps) RadiCola!

Rigby: Aw, man, this stuff was the best!

Mordecai: Whoa! This is from the 1984 Olympics. Dude, let's go take these out back and drink 'em all.

Skips: (from downstairs) Come on.

(Skips' voice is coming from an air vent, which Mordecai and Rigby approach)

Benson: Skips, we have a lot- we have a lot to do. I need to be around-

(Mordecai and Rigby watch Skips and Benson in the hallway through the air vent on the ceiling)

Skips: No, you should think it over, I'm telling you.

Benson: I don't know, Skips.

Skips: Seriously, Benson, you work too hard. You should take the night off.

Benson: Well... if you say so. But if anything happens-

Skips: Stop your worrying. Everything will be fine.

Benson: Okay.

Mordecai: Benson gone...

Rigby: ... plus soda...

Mordecai: ... equals...

Mordecai and Rigby: Party! Ohhhhh!

(We cut to the Computer Room. Mordecai is using the computer as Rigby watches. They are on a social networking site)

Rigby: Him, him, her, him—whoa, definitely invite her.

(Muscle Man enters the computer room with Hi Five Ghost just behind)

Muscle Man: Hey, jerk-weeds. Get off the computer. I got sign-up time. You know how long my downloads take.

Rigby: We're busy inviting people to our party.

Muscle Man: What? Your parties suck. I was at the last one, and there weren't even any chicks.

Mordecai: Yeah, well, just you wait. This party's gonna be awesome.

Muscle Man: I highly doubt it. (High-fives Hi Five Ghost)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm, hmm. Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm.

(We cut to the Kitchen. Mordecai and Rigby are unpacking sacks of groceries)

Mordecai and Rigby: We gonna paaaaar-ty!

Mordecai: Got some chips, got some dips!

Rigby: (rapping) Some call me cheap, bit of a freeloader, but I bought cups for that old-school soda!

Mordecai: (rapping) I don't mean to brag, I don't mean to boast, but here's some hummus for these mini-toasts!

Rigby: Huu-mmus!

Mordecai: Humm-uus!!

Mordecai and Rigby: (chanting) Hummus!

Benson: Why are you guys yelling hummus?

(Benson and Skips enter via the back door as Mordecai and Rigby try to hide their party supplies)

Mordecai: Uh, no reason.

Benson: Doesn't matter anyway, 'cause while I'm on my night off tonight, Skips is in charge. That's right. This guy is gonna be my eyes and ears.

(Skips nods approvingly as Benson strides and whistles his way to the back door and outside)

Skips: This better be some party.

(We cut to the living room. Skips is on the couch looking bored. Next to him is Pops, asleep)

Rigby: Man, this party is off the hook! 'Cause we got sod-aaaaa in the house!

(Skips snatches a can of RadiCola from Rigby)

Skips: What? 1984 Olympics? Are you sure we can drink this?

Rigby: Sure you can. It's aged to perfection.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost enter)

Muscle Man: Ha ha ha, ha ha ha! Told you this party was gonna blow.

(The doorbell rings and three human guests enter, two male, one female)

Guest 1: I think this is the place... Oh, sorry. We thought there was a party here. (The new guests turn and leave)

Muscle Man: Ohhhhh! I told you, I told you! Your party is lame! Ha ha ha ha ha!

(Mordecai and Rigby go into the kitchen)

Mordecai: Dude, This party is tanking fast. There's gotta be a way to step this up. (Mordecai hits the TV and it switches on. We hear a German voiceover artist speaking over a commercial showing four bored party guests sitting on a couch. It transpires that this is "Party Pete")

Party Pete: Ist your party tanking fast? Vell, I've got the answer.

(On screen, Party Pete slides into view, accompanied by two beautiful women. The four party guests on the couch stand up in shock and a fifth appears next to them)

Party Guests: Party Pete! (The Party Pete logo slides onto the screen as a robot voice says Party Pete. The screen cuts to a rocking party, with dozens of guests dancing under the disco ball in the same apartment as the lame party)

Party Pete Guest: Awesome party, bro.

Party Pete: Ist your party not hardy? Call me. (We see Party Pete reclining on a massive ice sculpture of himself outside) Act now and get ze free promotional ice sculpture. Vat ist you vaiting for? (The robot voice says Party Pete again as the message 'Party Pete, $50/hr, Call Now, 555-0177 flashes on screen)

Mordecai: (Back in the kitchen) Aw, man. We need that guy.

Rigby: What? Why would you want to pay fifty dollars for some dude to come to our house? What's he even gonna do? He's just gonna come and eat all our food.

Mordecai: Do you have a better idea?

Rigby: Yes, I do.

(Back in the living room, Rigby puts a cassette in the tape deck and starts dancing)

Rigby: Yay-uh! Yay-uh! Yay-uh! Yeaaaaah!!! (Rigby dances and shouts along to the terrible, discordant music. Mordecai covers his ears) Woo! Come on, Skips! Dance!

Skips: (Slaps away Rigby's hand) Don't touch me!

Pops: Oh, it hurts to listen!

(The tape player begins to overheat, then spits out the cassette's tape and stops playing. Muscle Man whistles like a bomb dropping, then makes a fart sound)

Muscle Man: Hear that? That's the sound of your party failing! Dance to that, losers! Ha ha ha ha ha!

(Cuts to outside Benson's apartment. Benson is wearing a robe and leaning out of his bathroom window)

Benson: Just relax, Benson. Everything's gonna be fine, Benson. Skips has got this. Yeah.

(Inside, soothing music plays as Benson removes his robe and gets into a full bathtub surrounded by candles)

Benson: Ahhhhh... You deserve this, Benson. Yes. Yes, I do.

(Back at the park house, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Skips, and Pops are on the couch watching TV)

Man on TV: ... and slowly decapitates him. (The sound of a sword slashing is heard as a hand on screen points to a jar with a tiny fly in it) And that was the mating of the Toledo horsefly, narrated by me... (Mordecai watches in horror from the kitchen)

Mordecai: (To Rigby, in the kitchen) This party's hit rock bottom, dude. Muscle Man was right. (Mordecai walks to the phone and begins to dial)

Rigby: What are you doing?

Mordecai: Calling Party Pete.

(Mordecai dials 555-0177 on the kitchen wall phone)

Party Pete: (clears throat) Mm, ja, ja, Party Pete.

Mordecai: Party Pete?

(Back in the living room)

Skips: Alright, let's get outta here.

(Skips, Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi Five Ghost make to leave. Mordecai and Rigby chase after them)

Mordecai: Whoa! Whoa! Where's everybody going?

Skips: We've had enough. We're gonna head out.

Muscle Man: Yeah, losers. Takes more than expired soda to have a party. It takes guests with breasts, and mine don't count.

Mordecai: Guys, people are coming. They're just fashionably late.

Skips: (checks watch) It's ten thirty. Nobody else is gonna come.

(The doorbell rings)

Mordecai: (nervously) I wonder who that could be, ha ha...

(Mordecai and Rigby walk to the front door)

Mordecai: Quick, how much money you got?

Rigby: Three dollars.

Mordecai: I've got five.

(Mordecai and Rigby open the door to find Party Pete hip-thrusting, with one the attractive women from the commercial on each arm. Bass-heavy dance music plays)

Party Pete: Ya have ze fifty dollars?

Mordecai: Huh! Great, you're here. How much partying will this buy?

Party Pete: Eight bucks? About ten minutes.

Mordecai: That's perfect! That's all we need to get the party started again.

Party Pete: Okay, ve'll do it. Chrissy, Janet, Get zem ze eight dollar version of ze promotional ice sculpture.

(Chrissy and Janet, the hot women, walk off the porch and return with a life-sized ice sculpture of a urinal, which they take inside)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa... Cool...

(Back inside, Party Pete emerges from the hallway into the living room in a party pose)

Party Pete: Hey, everybody! Ready to party?

(Party Pete removes Rigby's broken cassette from the player and replaces it with his own, hitting play. Electronic dance music plays as Party Pete dances. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are amazed by Party Pete's dancing skills. Janet and Chrissy dance and grind next to Pops and Skips, who couldn't be happier. Pops starts dancing as well, and we see a montage of increasingly crazy party photos, before the scene ends with Mordecai and Rigby taunting Muscle Man back in the living room)

Mordecai: (In something of an Australian accent) Aw, yeah! In yo' face, Muscle Man!

Rigby: (In the same accent) Yeah! In your face!

(Party Pete stops the cassette then points to his watch)

Party Pete: OK, ten minutes are up, ve're going to go.

Muscle Man: Aw yeah! This party's lame... again!

(Party Pete, Janet, and Chrissy begin to leave. Mordecai spots a crate of RadiCola next to the couch)

Mordecai: Party Pete! Can't you stick around for one soda? (offers Party Pete a can of RadiCola)

Party Pete: Whoa, I remember zis stuff. I suppose one couldn't hurt. (Party Pete cracks the soda open and takes a sip) Mmm, yeah. You keep zese coming und I keep ze party going.

(Bass heavy music resumes as Party Pete downs the can and crushes it with a manic look in his eye)

Skips: No good can come of this.

(Outside we see around 20 guests approaching the house. Guest 1 from earlier is the first to enter the house and living room.)

Guest 1: I knew we'd find the party!

(Party Pete is now guzzling another can of soda as everyone cheers)

Party Pete: Party Pete in de hooooouuse!

(Dozens of guests have assembled in the house and are dancing wildly)

Mordecai and Rigby: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

(Party Pete runs from female guest to female guest, kissing one of them on the cheek and blowing their hair)

Rigby: Dude! This party is insane!

Mordecai: I know! The centaurs even showed up!

(One of the centaurs backs into the frozen urinal)

Centaur 1: Huh? What the? Suck on this, promotional ice sculpture!

(Centaur 1 pours a soda into the urinal, crushes a can in it, then throws it out the window)

Mordecai: Ha, ha! We did it, dude! Whoa. Check that out.

(Muscle Man is dancing with a beautiful, tall, dark-haired woman. He sees Mordecai and Rigby watching him have a good time and pauses, crossing his arms)

Mordecai: Having a good time, Muscle Man?

(A male guest, whose jacket is on fire, approaches Mordecai and Rigby)

Guest on fire: Hey, wassup, Mordy and Rigbird? You remember how your toilet like used to flush, an' also like how it used to not be on fire? Anyway, phone call for ya. Some angry dude named Benson. Later.

Mordecai: (nervously) Heh... hello?

Benson: (In a robe in his apartment, talking into the phone and standing by the window) Is that a party I hear?

Mordecai: Uh, no, that's the TV.

Benson: Oh, yeah? (angrily) I can hear music coming from the house! (He looks at the house, glowing from the party, from his window) I think I'm gonna come down for a little visit. See ya soon!

Mordecai: (Hears the phone hang up and the dial tone, then speaks to Rigby) Uhh... dude, Benson is coming. We gotta find Party Pete, fast.

(A huge yellow glow is seen in front of a huge group of revelers. Mordecai and Rigby try to fight their way through)

Mordecai and Rigby: Party Pete! Party Pete!

(They make it through to the front and see Party Pete glowing and dancing wildly, with several empty soda cans all over the floor. Mordecai picks one up)

Mordecai: Ugh, Party Pete? How many of these have you had?

Rigby: Seriously, man! You gotta stop!

(Rigby tries to grab Party Pete's arm but the glow shocks him backwards as he yelps in pain. Party Pete stops dancing and turns to face them, his eyes nothing but white fire)

Party Pete: Stop? I do not vant to.

(Party Pete levitates into the air and emits a flash of green light that illuminates the sky outside through the window. He expands into a sphere and becomes a human disco ball, spinning and glowing)

Mordecai: Dude, he's unstoppable!

Skips: (Enters with Pops, and carries a crate of soda) Not for long. If we give him more soda, he'll grow brighter and brighter until he exhausts all his energy. Then he'll burn out like a star.

(The four grab soda cans)

Mordecai: Come on. Let's do this.

(The four throw their soda cans at Party Pete, who stretches out his arms and stops them in mid-air. They open by themselves and the contents fly into his mouth. His face expands to hideous proportions)

Mordecai: It's working! Quick, we need more soda!

Skips: We're all out.

Mordecai: Wait. I know where there's more soda.

(The four rush outside and back in, carrying the frozen urinal, which has some soda in it)

Mordecai: Alright everybody, on three. One, two, three!

(They throw the urinal at Party Pete. It melts, and the ice water and soda fly into his mouth. The music hits a high tempo as Party Pete looks ready to explode)

Random Guest: Dude! Party Pete's gonna blow!

Mordecai: Hit the deck!

(Skips grabs Pops and jumps behind an upturned table, Mordecai and Rigby leap behind the couch, and the guests all scatter out of the house as Party Pete screams and finally explodes in a flash of white light. When Mordecai and Rigby emerge from behind the couch, the lighting is back to normal but the living room is completely wrecked, and the upstairs toilet has fallen through the ceiling)

Mordecai: We're dead. This place is completely trashed. We'll never get this place cleaned up before Benson comes back.

Rigby: It could be worse.

(The toilet spontaneously catches fire)

Rigby: That's the coolest thing I've ever seen.

(The centaurs walk up to Mordecai and Rigby)

Centaur Leader: Yo, that party was awesome! We'll totally help you clean up.

(Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost also appear)

Pops: And we're here to help, too!

(A montage follows of everyone cleaning the entire house in record time. Janet and Chrissy get into the Party Pete van and drive off just as Benson's car comes over the hill. Benson is driving and looks furious. Rigby spots him from the window)

Rigby: Oh, man! Benson's coming!

Mordecai: Everybody out through the kitchen!

(The centaurs and park workers, except for Mordecai and Rigby, all run through the living room)

Unidentified Centaur: Wicked party, duders!

Pops: Capital soiree!

Muscle Man: (Carrying an armful of trash) I guess I was wrong. That party was kinda awesome. I'm gonna go collapse in my bathtub now.

(Benson's car comes to a halt just outside. Without even shutting off the engine, he sprints up the front steps and into the house, running into the living room, where he sees Mordecai and Rigby playing video games in a spotless environment)

Benson: You guys are dead. I knew I couldn't trust yo... (Pans out to Mordecai and Rigby) What the...?

Rigby: Oh, hey Benson. What's up?

Benson: What are you guys doing?

Mordecai: We're just playing video games.

Benson: Hmmm...

(Benson runs from room to room to inspect them for a hidden party or damage)

Benson: Whoa-ho! You guys are clean! Sorry for doubting you.

(Mordecai and Rigby make 'aw shucks' noises)

Benson: I wanna do something nice for you two.

(Mordecai and Rigby make 'aw shucks' noises again)

Benson: Yep, you guys of all people would appreciate this. I've been saving some soda from the 1984 Olympics for a special occasion.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan)

Mordecai: Uh, wait what?

Benson: So let's crack open some cold ones! They're up in the attic, come on!

(Benson marches upstairs as Mordecai and Rigby stand up in the living room)

Mordecai: We're dead.

Rigby: Ugh! I lost again.

Mordecai: Hmph. Hmph.

Rigby: This stupid thing was throwing me off. (Takes a magazine that reads "Mustaches Monthly - SPECIAL HANDLEBAR ISSUE!" out of the couch.)

Mordecai: Dude! Pops' Mustaches Monthly! Benson told us to deliver this weeks ago. You have to give this to Pops.

Rigby: What?! Why do I have to?

Mordecai: Because you're the tool who crammed it between the sofa cushions.

Rigby: I can't get up now. I'm going to lose this sweet butt cheek groove I've been working into this couch! It looks just like me!

(The butt cheek mark on the couch is visible.)

Mordecai: I'm not going up those stairs, dude.

Rigby: Fine, let's play rock-paper-scissors for it.

(Rigby plays paper and Mordecai plays rock.)

Rigby: Hmph hmph.

Mordecai: (groans) Whatever.

(Rigby plays the video game as Mordecai approaches Pops' room. We hear water running.)

Mordecai: Pops. Yo, Pops. I found your Mustache Monthly. (Puts Pops' Moustaches Monthly on a chair and turns his head around, before seeing Pops, just out of the shower and naked.) Aaaaagh!

Pops: Aaaaagh!

Mordecai: Aaaaagh!

Pops: Aaaaagh!

Mordecai: Aaaaagh! (In all the confusion, he now catches a glimpse of Pops' "junk mail").

Pops: Aaaaagh! (Pops covers his "junk mail" with his hat. Mordecai covers his eyes. They both try to leave but they're in each other's ways".)

Mordecai: (breathing) Uh... uh... uh... uh...

Pops: (breathing) Uh... uh... uh... uh...

(Mordecai finally escapes Pops' room as Pops goes into his bathroom. Mordecai goes downstairs and sits on the couch.)

Mordecai: Stop playing for a second. When I went upstairs, Pops was getting out of the shower.

Rigby: Yeah, so?

Mordecai: And he didn't have a towel.

Rigby: Ewww!

Mordecai: I tried not to look and just give him the magazine but I saw his...

Rigby: His junk mail? Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

Mordecai: No, dude, I'm mentally scarred. It's like the image is glued in the inside of my eyelids. Every saggy, wrinkled, shriveled, pasty...

Rigby: Whoa, whoa! Don't put it in my head.

Mordecai: This is your fault. You have to help me.

Rigby: I'll help you to forget it if you promise to stop talking about it.

Mordecai: Deal. (They shake hands.)

(Cut to the arcade...)

Rigby: What you need is some Strong Johns.

Mordecai: Let's do it.

(They begin to play Strong Johns. Rigby starts losing and Mordecai starts winning, but then Mordecai sees both Johns turn into two versions of naked Pops.)

Mordecai: Ugh! (He runs away.)

Rigby: Mordecai, wait! (Sighs)

(Cut to the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: If this doesn't take your mind off of Pops, nothing will.

Mordecai: What, coffee? Thanks, dude, but I don't see how...

Rigby: (turns Mordecai's face to the other way) No, dude. Margaret.

Margaret: (While taking an order) So, that's two sandwiches and one soda.

(Mordecai does a love stare.)

Rigby: Hmmm? Hmmm?

Mordecai: All right.

Rigby: (while shaking Mordecai) Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm? Hmmm?

Mordecai: (pushes Rigby) All right. It worked.

Margaret: Hey, guys.

(Mordecai stares dreamily at her until seeing her face looks like Pops'.)

Margaret: Can I get you something to drink, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Aaaaargh! (runs away)

(Cut to the Movie Shack Hut...)

Rigby: Come on, let's get some movies. That'll get your mind off Pops.

(Mordecai looks at all the movies)

Mordecai: (Cut to a bunch of movie covers with naked Pops on them) Aah! (Cut to another row of naked Pops movie covers) Ohh...wha? (Covers his eyes) Ohh...

Rigby: See anything you like?

Mordecai: No...

Rigby: I'll go see if they have Good Cop, Sad Cop. (While Mordecai groans, Rigby goes to the checkout. We see a man watching Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent.) Hey, man, have any copies of Good Cop, Sad Cop? (The employee won't respond.) Hello?

VG: Sure, man. Let me check for you. (Types on his keyboard to check for Good Cop, Sad Cop.)

Rigby: So, no then?

VG: Oh, yeah. No.

Rigby: All right. Just these and whatever my friend's getting.

(Cut to Mordecai looking at a Cowboyz poster. He groans like he saw naked Pops instead of the cowboy.)

Rigby: I guess just these. (Pushes over the movies and notices the TV.) What are you watching?

VG:  Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent.

Rigby: Is it good?

VG: I watch Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent  all day everyday. All day, everyday...

(Anime characters fly around the screen as J-Pop plays. A character with black hair dressed in a blue suit runs away from an attacking UFO. The blue-suited character and another character with blonde hair and a tuxedo fight each other using superpowers. Stars pop out of the blue-suited character's eyes.)

Rigby: Aw, how do you watch that? It's like barfing rainbows in my eyes.

VG: I watch Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent all day, every day.

Rigby: You already said that.

VG: I watch it all day, every day.

Rigby: Dude, you already said that. Don't you remember?

VG: All day, every day.

Rigby: What?

VG: I watch it all day, every day.

(The two characters fight each other again.)

VG: Every day.

Rigby: Whoa...

(Rigby ejects the tape and grabs it.)

Rigby: I'm just gonna borrow this.

(Back at the house, Rigby puts the tape in the VCR)

Rigby: Trust me, man. This will make you forget.

Mordecai: (covering his eyes) No, no. I'm not looking at anything ever again. Every time I open my eyes, I see Pops naked.

Rigby: Just give it a chance.

Mordecai: No!

(Rigby grabs Mordecai's arms.)

Rigby: Look at it! Look at it! Look at it!

Mordecai: Get off! I'm not looking at a stupid--

(Mordecai opens his eyes wide and sees Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent on screen in all its glory. He is spellbound and his pupils expand to massive proportions.)

Rigby: Yes!

(Rolls of film fly out of Mordecai's eyes and into the bright TV screen.)

Rigby: Coooool...

(Each film cel shows a piece of Mordecai's memory. Rigby tries to grab one, but things spiral out of control and Mordecai floats in the air, with film still flying into the TV. The music from Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent grows faster and faster until finally everything stops and Mordecai drops onto the couch, the TV off.)

Rigby: Did it work?

(The TV shows 'THE END'. Mordecai groans and mumbles incoherently.)

Rigby: Mordecai! Do you remember seeing Pops naked? Pops naked? Nude? In the buff? Naked Pops, naked Pops, naked Pops. (Mordecai doesn't respond. His head is slumped onto his chest.) Awesome! Dude, it totally worked! Up high! (Mordecai doesn't take the hi-five.) Let's... get you some coffee.

(At the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: Margaret! The usual: two coffees, please. Better make that espresso.

Margaret: Hey Mordecai, you're back! Feeling better?

(Mordecai groans in response.)

Margaret: (nervously) Mordecai?

(Mordecai groans more and Margaret walks away to Eileen.)

Eileen: Oh my gosh, is Mordecai ignoring you?

Margaret: Is it just me, or does Mordecai look like he's been working out?

Rigby: Mordecai, snap out of it. We're finally gonna have some fun! Just two friends hangin' out, lettin' the good times roll. Like old times!

(A montage scene follows. Rigby puts on his 'TEAM RIGBONE AND MURDECAI' bowling gear and rolls a spare at the bowling alley. Mordecai stares straight ahead, slack-jawed and unresponsive. Next, Rigby tries to prank Muscle Man by throwing 'Balogna' all over his car, but Mordecai doesn't laugh or exchange a hi-five as Rigby yells in frustration.)

Rigby: Augh! Gimme back my friend!

(Outside Skips' house, Mordecai stands unconscious as Rigby talks to Skips.)

Rigby: He's been like this ever since he watched a video. And now he doesn't remember any of the stuff we used to do.

Skips: Video? It wasn't Planet Starlight: Chasers Excellent, was it?

Rigby: Uh... Yeah, why?

Skips: We have to watch the tape.

(In the house, Skips sits with Rigby and Mordecai on the couch as Rigby presses play on the remote. The music kicks in, and Rigby and Skips are pulled into the TV via the film reels in their eyes. They land in a dark environment like Regular Show's title screen.)

Rigby: We're in! Wait, where are we?

Mordecai: We're in the tape, dude.

Rigby: Mordecai! Dude! We're here to rescue you.

Mordecai: What's the point? Whether I'm in here or out there, I can't forget about seeing Pops naked.

Rigby: Augh! You're still thinking about that? Get over it already.

Mordecai: You don't get it, dude. It's not something you can just un-see.

Skips: We have to change your memory.

Mordecai: What do you mean?

Skips: If we find your memory of Pops and cover it, you won't remember seeing him naked.

Mordecai: Where do we start?

Skips: Your memories are over there.

(Skips points past a lot of doors to one glass door that looks like the entry to the house. "Mordecai's Memories" is on its front.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa.

Rigby: Weird.

(The trio enter the door, and the room inside flips vertically to become the Coffee Shop.)

Rigby: Why are we in the coffee shop?

(Several different Mordecais, Margarets and Rigbys are standing around talking, joking, arguing, etc.)

Skips: These are his memories.

Rigby: Whoa! (sees Mordecai whaling on him on a table) Oh, yeah, I remember that too.

Skips: This isn't the memory we need.

Mordecai: Yeah. We need to find Pops' room.

Rigby: Easy: let's go back to the house. There's the exit.

(Through the exit door is the video score, with VG watching Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent.)

VG: All day, every day. (quieter) All day, every day.

Skips: Memory isn't logical. We'll have to keep looking 'til we find the-

(Through the video store door, they enter the park.)

Mordecai: The house! We're getting closer.

(The three enter the house. The stairs up to Pops' room suddenly grow to several times their normal length and the trio ascend through an Escher-style drawing of the house, covered with framed pictures.)

Mordecai, Rigby and Skips: Pops' room!

(The door opens. Pops is standing naked, facing away from the door.)

Rigby: Oh, gross!

Skips: Quick, cover him with that blanket.

(Mordecai and Rigby grab the blanket and make to cover Pops, but the floor creaks under Mordecai's foot, causing Pops to turn toward the sound. Pops laughs, jumps out of the way, and so begins an epic chase through the house, with Pops escaping from the room by crawling on the ceiling.)

Mordecai: What... the...?

Skips: Get him!

(When the trio follow Pops through the door they fall from the sky onto the park grass. They chase Pops through a crowd of Bensons.)

Crowd of Bensons: You idiots... if you don't clean this place up... you're fired! You're fired! You're fired! (repeats) Hang on... you're fired! (keeps repeating)

(Pops escapes through a door to nowhere marked Exit. The trio follow him through and end up emerging from a couch, in a room with several couches, large and small. Through a trap door, they end up back inside the tape, chasing Pops.)

Rigby: (while sprinting) Pops isn't really like this. We're never gonna catch him! How come he's so fast?

Mordecai: I don't know! I just remember everything happening really fast. Like, I put down the magazine and all of a sudden Pops was there. It was just like he uh-- (Mustaches Monthly flies from the sky and hits Mordecai in the face.) Huh?

Rigby: (gasps) That's it! Just start remembering stuff, dude?

Mordecai: What?

Skips: You have to use your memories to catch Pops.

Rigby: Think of something!

(Mordecai struggles to remember, and the golf cart appears piece-by-piece.)

Rigby: Think harder.

Mordecai: I'm trying!

(The golf cart appears in full.)

Rigby: Yes!

(The trio jump in the cart and Mordecai drives it towards Pops)

Rigby: He's still too fast!

Skips: Remember something to block his path.

Mordecai: I can't!

Rigby: Remember that time we ate all that cereal?

Mordecai: Yeah, we must have eaten like a million boxes because you wanted that lame Strong Johns figurine.

(A cascade of cereal and milk forces Pops to change his path.)

Mordecai: Uh... I remember when Margaret had that gigantic boyfriend!

(A giant, bald, musclar man appears. Pops nearly gets ground-punched as the guys in the cart cheer, but this turns the giant's attention to them, and the cart only narrowly avoids being crushed.)

Rigby: Nice!

Mordecai: Margaret's boyfriends were always really lame.

Skips: We have to cut off his path.

Mordecai: Uhhh... I remember that crazy steep cliff at the end of the park! (A huge cliff ramps upwards.) Ha ha, now he's got nowhere to go.

Rigby: He's not slowing down!

(Pops runs to the top of the cliff and gracefully dives off as the trio pull the cart to a halt right at the edge, watching him fall.)

Rigby: Now what?

(Mordecai turns the cart around and drives full-speed back towards the cliff's edge.)

Rigby: Dude, what are you doing?

Mordecai: Getting rid of that memory.

(The cart falls through the air. Pops, laughing, is dancing as he falls down. Mordecai leaps after him with the blanket and manages to smother him, covering his body.)

Mordecai: I did it! I caught him!

(Mordecai finds the blanket is now empty and the ground is approaching fast. The three scream and get ready for impact.)

Mordecai: Uh... uh... I remember the time we ripped a hole in that kid's bouncy castle!

(A bouncy castle appears on the ground. The three land safely, but the castle deflates and screaming kids scatter in all directions.)

Rigby: Did it work?

Mordecai: Yeah, I think so. How do we get out of here, Skips?

(Skips shrugs.)

VG: I think I can help.

(VG is standing next to them, looking clean-cut and eager.)

Rigby: It's the guy from the video store!

VG: There's a tape sticking out of that wall over there. Grab onto it and you should be home free.

Rigby: Don't you wanna leave, too?

VG: Nah. I'm kinda into not having to work for the rest of my life.

(The trio walk towards a massive TV and video as VG waves them goodbye. They grab the video sticking out of the wall.)

Mordecai: Here goes...

(The Planet Chasers: Starlight Excellent theme plays as the tape reels fly back out of the TV and into the bodies of Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips on the couch)

Mordecai: It's gone! Naked Pops is gone! I don't remember it anymore!

(Benson walks into the living room, wearing a towel, and sees all the film.)

Benson: What did you guys do? What is this mess? I can't even take a shower around here without you guys screwing things u--

Mr. Maellard: Snacks disappearing from the snack bar? Holes in the walls? And 500 dollars worth of prank phone calls? It's ridiculous! What are you doing to my park, Beanteen?

Benson: But, sir, it's not my fault. It's Mordecai and Rigby. (points) It's right here in my report.

Mr. Maellard: Are you my park manager, Beanteen?

Benson: Yes, sir.

Mr. Maellard: Then everything that happens here is your fault.

Benson: Well, yes, technically but...

Mr. Maellard: Say it...

Benson: Everything that happens here is my fault.

(Mordecai and Rigby crash into the office with Mr. Maellard's limo.)

Mr. Maellard: My car!

Mordecai: Sorry, Benson, remember how I told you that I could drive stick? Well, I'm a little rusty.

Rigby: I told you you should have let me be the one to park it.

Mr. Maellard: Why are they driving my car when I specifically told YOU to park it?!

Benson: I did, sir, but I delegated it to Mordecai and Rigby.

Mordecai: Uh, this is getting a little awkward so we're gonna take off.

(Mordecai starts backing out of the office.)

Benson: Wait!

(The limo crashes to the ground, causing the alarm to go off.)

Mr. Maellard: That's it. Emergency meeting tomorrow. Things are going to change around here.

(Dramatic music plays as Benson looks rather sad. Clock transition to the outside of the park the next day. A blonde lady stands next to Mr. Maellard as he gives a speech to the park workers.)

Mr. Maellard: I'm sure you're all anxious to get back to work so let me make this brief to you now. Beancan, you're being demoted.

Benson: What?

Mr. Maellard: Everyone, this is Susan. She'll be taking over Beanton's duties at the park.

Susan: Thank you, Mr. Maellard. First, I would like to thank Benson for agreeing to step down from his position.

Benson: What?

Susan: I know this park's productivity has been inadequate for a long time. But now that I'm here, we're gonna get this park back in working order the Susan way. So Pops and Skips, I need you to clean the north-end fountain, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are on snack bar duty, Mordecai and Rigby... (flips page) ...and Benson, you guys will be raking the leaves.

Benson: What?

(It fades to Mordecai, Rigby and Benson raking leaves.)

Mordecai: Come on, Benson, we gotta rake these leaves, dude.

Benson: I can't do this.

Mordecai: Look, you're bummed out about getting demoted, but if you give it a chance, you'll see it's not that bad.

Benson: This... is horrible.

Mordecai: No, it's not, you're just in a bad mood. Look, you just need to take your mind off of it for a while and have some fun.

Rigby: Yeah, man, we can come back later and finish these leaves.

Benson: Ha, this is so typical. You get bored so you just slack off instead of finishing your work.

Mordecai: It's not slacking, we're just taking a break. And besides, it's not like you're working that hard anyway.

Rigby: Yeah, you're raking like an old man that has a fatter old man holding his arms down.

Benson: I don't feel like raking now, OKAY?!

Rigby: I'm just saying.

Benson: What if Susan catches us? She'll probably fire us for not working!

Mordecai: Dude, just calm down. We'll just pretend like we're working until she goes away. (M&R walk off)

Benson: Yeah, right, like anyone would ever fall for that.

Rigby: It always worked on you.

Benson: Ugh, fine. As long as it gets me out of raking these leaves.

(A montage of MR&B having fun begins. Rigby pours a bowl of cereal and shows it to Benson, but he turns his back to them. Later, M&R are reading comics. Rigby holds up a comic for Benson, but he crosses his arms and rejects. Later, Benson is actually having fun slacking as he plays stick hockey with M&R. Benson wins, and he smiles, going into another game, which he also wins. The three are then seeing floating in the fountain, relaxed. Then, they're seen playing video games while eating pizza, as well as putting their feet up on the table. Next, they drive up a grassy ramp with the golf cart and crush a sign that reads "keep off grass". They all cheer before spinning around in circles. Then, they're launching a water balloon from the roof, which hits Muscle Man. Next, they ride on icy cardboard bricks through the hills. Finally, the three drink sodas together, and Benson is clearly in a good mood as the montage ends.)

Benson: (laughs) I feel great!

Mordecai: See, I told you all you needed was a break. Now do you feel like getting back to work?

Benson: (laughs) No!

Mordecai: Wait, what? Dude, we have to go back to work eventually.

Benson: Yeah, right, I'm never working again.

Mordecai: No, seriously, we should go back to work. Susan's coming. (sure enough, she's walking down the steps. The three then approach Mr. Maellard's limo)

Benson: Ha, what's she gonna do?

Susan: Why aren't you all working?

Mordecai: Oh, uh, we were just washing Maellard's car, see, we're washing it, ha...ha... Come on, Benson, we're washing the car now.

Benson: I'm not washing the car.

Susan: Benson, why aren't you working?

Benson: Cause I don't feel like it.

Susan: Get back to work or I'll fire you.

Benson: Yeah? Do it.

Susan: Excuse me?

Benson: I've wasted my whole life at a dead-end job, and I'm not wasting another second working for you. (shrugs) So go ahead and fire me.

Susan: Okay, Benson, you're fired!

Benson: (Benson's face expression is still for a second)........ (put up arms) OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH! Come on, guys, lets get out of here!

Mordecai: Uh, actually Benson, we need this.

Rigby: Yeah, we need the money man.

Benson: Oh well, suit yourselves, I guess, but my life is happening right now and I'm gonna go live it. (Zooms out) Sayonara, suckers! WHOOOOO! WHOO-WHOO!

Susan: You two! Get back to work! (M&R get to washing the limo) Faster! (To Skips) And you, sweep those stairs! (to Pops) And you with the big head, finish those windows! (Pops scrubs the windows hard.) Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster, FASTER, FASTER! (Susan walks away from the cart as M&R work.)

Rigby: I don't want to work for Susan!

Mordecai: (somehow grew blonde hair tied back in a bun, like Susan) Dude, I know. (zoom closer into Mordecai's head)

Rigby: Mordecai?

(clock transition to Benson on a park bench)

Benson: Ah, jobless. Not a worry in the world. (paper flies onto handlebar of bench) Take that piece of trash for example. Normally, I do my duty as park manager and pick it up, but I say like it be someone else's problem, like nature's.

(Paper floats to a nearby tree. Benson lets out a sigh, and sees a hobo named Leon next to him)

Leon: You said it, brother. Who needs something like a job?

Benson: Right.

Leon: What does a job get ya? Some lousy money so you can buy things?

Benson: Right.

Leon: I'm Leon. But my friends call me Upt. That's short for Utopia, because I'm living the dream, man. (eats a sandwich)

Benson: I'm a...

Leon: I know who you are, Benson. Former park manager, now full-time slacker.

Benson: How did you know?

Leon" I used to be the park manager, and just like you, I gave it up for a life of slacking. Now, I don't worry about silly things like where Leon's gonna lay his head to sleep tonight cause sheet grats of a garbage compost is my pillow, the grease on my face is my shower. (Benson is shocked as the camera zooms into him.) Yes, sir, can't beat the life of a slacker, I'm proud to be the one to welcome you to your new life. (Benson starts running away.) Hey, where ya going?

Benson: I gotta get my old job back.

(clock transition to the house)

Benson: Hello? Susan? (He sees the back of Susan's head.) Susan, I need my old job back. (turns around to show that Mordecai has turned into a Susan lookalike, and so has Rigby.) What the?

Mordecai and Rigby: Benson, help us!

Benson: What happened?

Mordecai: (holds a spray bottle and a wiping cloth) The more we do what she says, the more we turn into... her!

Benson: Well, stop doing what she says!

Rigby: We can't.

Benson: Why not?

Mordecai: Because... she's standing right behind you.

(Benson turns around. Sure enough, she's standing right there, scaring Benson.)

Susan: What are you doing back here? Get out!

Benson: You're turning them into you! You can't do that! That's not how you manage a park.

Susan: What would you know about running a park?

Benson: I'll show you what I know. (hands M&R game controllers) Mordecai and Rigby, start playing video games.

Mordecai and Rigby: But we're supposed to clean.

Benson: Play video games or you're fired! (M&R sit down and start playing. They, for the most part, turn back to normal.) Play harder! Come on, put your feet up. (the dress pants and high heels turn into M&R's legs as they put their feet up) Eat this pizza while you play. (M&R are back to normal. Susan gets mad)

Susan: That's it! Mordecai and Rigby, go back to work!

Benson: No, you don't! Keep slacking!

(Susan's even more angry. Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost come into the room, also Susan-ized)

Rigby: Look! (shown as said) SKIPS!?!?!?!?!?!?!?! POPS?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? MUSCLE MAN AND HI-FIVE!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?!?!

Mordecai: Susan's turned them into Susans too.

Pops: Turn that off and clean up this mess!

Benson: Why don't you clean it?

(Muscle Man's hair slowly comes loose, and Hi Five Ghost grows his hand back. MM & Hi Five Ghost's faces are back to normal)

Benson: Everybody slack off, or you're fired!

(Muscle Man twirls his Susan jacket around in the air and Hi Five Ghost drinks a soda as they fade into their normal bodies. Skips goes to the corner and lays out playing cards, and his morph to his normal self rips his suit. Pops plays video games, morphing him into his normal self. Everyone's back to normal.)

Muscle Man: We did it!

(Everyone cheers. Susan gets really angry and growls like a monster before her body turns around and flies out the window. The park workers approach the window as a red, giant Susan comes out of the ground and eats the normal Susan. Her foot crushes the golf cart as the park workers look on.)

Giant Susan: GET BACK TO WORK!!!!

Benson: Don't listen to her! Keep slacking off!

Giant Susan: NO!!!! THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY TO DEAL WITH EMPLOYEES LIKE YOU...(Giant Susan walks off, and quickly comes back carrying a jail building.) IMMEDIATE TERMINATION. (roars)

Mr. Maellard: Susan! (she looks down) What on earth do you think you're doing?!

Giant Susan: I'M RUNNING YOUR PARK FOR YOU, YOU OLD FOOL!

Mr. Maellard: This isn't how you run a business!

(Giant Susan throws the jail building aside)

Giant Susan: YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS!!!! (picks Mr. Maellard up as Benson comes down the steps)

Mr. Maellard: AAAAAAaaaaaaAAAAaaaAAAAaaaaaaAAAAAUGGGGGHHH! Beanton, Beanton! Help me, Beanton!

Benson: It's Benson! And I can't do anything unless you give me my old job back.

Mr. Maellard: Okay, yes, yes, you have your job back.

Benson: And your car keys.

Mr. Maellard: My car keys?! (Benson gives him a look.) .....My car keys, of course!

(Maellard throws Benson the keys, and he catches them. He then gets in the limo and drives up to Susan)

Benson: (gets out of the limo) HEY, SUSAN! (she looks at him) YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!!!!! (Benson starts driving toward Giant Susan, and, suddenly, Leon drives up with the golf cart and jumps into the limo, causing the cart to tumble off.)


Benson: Leon!

Leon: I've got this, brother. I've already had my season in the sun, but you've still got a whole lifetime of slacking in front of ya.

Benson: Actually, I changed my... (Leon pushes Benson out of the limo and takes the wheel.)

Leon: Time for me to blow this slacker wonderland! (Leon flips the limo over, causing it to tumble, eventually breaking off the heels of Giant Susan's shoes) Utopia.

(The limo crashes into a brick wall, exploding on contact.)

Giant Susan: (trips and lets go of Mr. Maellard) AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!! NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! (falls into the pit, igniting a tall pillar of fire.)

(Benson walks over to the pit as the other park workers come up, congratulating him. Mr. Maellard walks up to Benson as well)

Mr. Maellard: Thank you, Benson, keep up the good work. (nudges Benson with cane and walks off. Everyone continues to congratulates him.)

Benson: Alright, alright! Everybody back to work. We've gotta get this mess cleaned up, now! (everyone but M&R walk off) And that means you Mordecai and Rigby. (hands Mordecai a broom and Rigby a shovel) You better keep working after I'm gone, because if I come back, and you're not, you're fired!

(Benson gets in the cart and drives away.)

Mordecai: Haha, yeah, good to have you back, Benson! (to Rigby) You wanna go play video games?

Rigby: Yeah-yuh.

(Benson looks at M&R walk up the steps in the car's rear-view mirror.)

Benson: Ahhh... It's good to be back.

Benson: (Runs through with choices for game night.) Ahem. Alright. The options for this month's game night are: (reads list) checkers, cards, Double Dutch, Tiddly Winks and-- (pauses) "My Mom" isn't a game, Muscle Man. That doesn't even make sense.

Muscle Man: Looks like I win! (high fives Hi Five Ghost)

Pops: Let's play Ball-bo Catcher! (plays with the Ball-Bo Catcher and laughs)

Skips: A crossword puzzle?

Benson: Okay, let's vote. (Mordecai yawns) Yes, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Oh, nothing.

Benson: Do you have a better idea?

Mordecai: We could play one of those stale old games we usually play.

Rigby: Or we could play the sci-fi fantasy epic of the century! (holds up game box) Behold, The Realm of Darthon!

(Mordecai waves his arms while vocalizing)

Benson: So, what is it?

Mordecai: It's a role-playing game. We make up an adventure and you guys try to beat it.

Rigby: You can use magic and stuff.

Pops: A game of imagination? What fun!

Muscle Man: Sounds lame.

Rigby: No way,

Mordecai: The guy at the store told us it's the hottest RPG of the year.

Benson: (sighs) All in favor?

(everyone else but Skips agrees)

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOOOOO! Darthon! Darthon! (high-five) WHOOOOO!

Rigby: Get ready for the best game night of your life.

(The scene then cuts to the kitchen. The park workers are all playing Realm of Darthon.)

Mordecai: Your party walks down a long hallway and reaches a locked door. What do you do?

Muscle Man: I smash it open with my war claw! Then, a bunch of ladies come out, and they're all, "Ooh Muscle Man, quit pinching my butt with your war claw!"

Rigby: Roll the 50-sided die to see if you unlock the door.

Skips: (looks at the die and marbles) All we have is a 48-sided die and two marbles.

Rigby: Close enough.

(Muscle Man rolls the die and marbles... only for all of them to roll off the table.)

Muscle Man: Did it work?'

Rigby: (looks at chart) Uhhh... I don't think so.

Muscle Man: This blows.

Pops: (waving hand) Mordecai! Mordecai! (in western accent) But I'll reckon I'd like a turn now!

Mordecai: (looking at book) Cyborg cowboys take three days to awaken from hypersleep. Sorry, Pops.

(Pops moans)

Skips: Can't he cast a saving throw?

Mordecai: Uhhh...

Benson: What does all this stuff mean? Are we even in Darthon yet? (Mordecai flips through the book, moaning) Or is that just an artifact for something?

Mordecai: (flips through book, then quickly closes it) Uhhh... your party is suddenly ambushed by a flock of manbats! Skips the Mighty gets first strike! (Skips rolls the dice and marbles)

Rigby: Let's see... (calculates) Pirate samurai have plus two times two shen... minus three charisma... divide by number of geese... Do we have a protractor?

Benson: I'm outta here.

(All of the park workers, except for M&R, get up and walk away)

Muscle Man: Worst game night ever!

Rigby: (moans) Dude, they're right! (knocks away stand) This game sucks!

Mordecai: Let's get our money back.

The scene then cuts to to Comics Plus and More, etc. There's a long line of people standing in front of the store. Mordecai and Rigby (the duo) walk past the crowd to get to the front)

Rigby: Out of the way! Out of the way, everybody!

Mordecai: Coming through, coming through!

Rigby: Out of the way! Out of the way people!

(they've reached the front of the line)

Mordecai: We're here for a refund.

Clerk: I'd love to give you a refund, but you need a receipt for that.

Rigby: I got a receipt right here. (slaps receipt onto the table)

Clerk: Excellent. And now the unopened product?

Mordecai: What?! You can't return it if it's opened?!

Clerk: Well, yes! It's clearly stated on the back of your receipt.

Rigby: What?! That's lame! You can barely even see the writing!

Clerk: Yes, well, perhaps if you learned to read, it would be easy for you to see. Good day, gentlemen!

Rigby: Dude, just give us our money back. This game blows! (pounds on table)

Clerk: Uh, The Realm of Darthon does not blow! You're probably doing it wrong. It's a role-playing game. You have to use your imagination.

Rigby: No way, dude! The game is the problem, not us!

Person in Line 1: Uh, hey, are you guys gonna be wrapping this up soon?

Clerk: Oh yeah. We're done here.

(The person goes up to the table to get TRoD checked out)

Mordecai: Hmph. Hmph. Okay, I guess you won't mind if we tell people how "cool" your game is! (to the people) Hey, everybody! Don't waste your time waiting in line for this huge piece. It's probably the worst game we've ever played.

Rigby: Yeah, and he won't even give us a refund. This guy doesn't give refunds, people! (everyone puts their copies back on the shelf)

Clerk: Let's go! (pushes M&R out the door) I want you two out of my store, now! (slams door)

Mordecai: Ugh! We can't let that guy get away with this. Dude, we spent the last of our cash on it! We have to get our money back.

Rigby: Yeah! (pause) So, how do we do that?

Mordecai: (zoom into his face) We'll just sabotage his business until he gives us our refund.

(The scene then cuts to sometime later at the store. M&R drive up in the golf cart, wearing cheaply-made costumes)

Person in Line 2: Heh, nice outfits! (chuckles) Losers. (everyone else in line laughs)

Rigby: You don't like these costumes? But they're from the "Make Your Own" section of the Darthon gamebook. (everyone in line gasps)

Mordecai: That's right. (the clerk looks on, and walks out) We followed the instructions perfectly.

Clerk: But you used toilet paper rolls, instead of paper towel rolls. The costumes look awesome when you do it right.

Rigby: Yeah? Do they look as awesome as the game pieces? (holds up an ugly-looking wizard character piece)

Person in Line 3: Ugh! (walks away)

Clerk: W-w-w-wait! There's lots of other characters if you don't like the pixie sorcerer.

Mordecai: (holds up book of characters) No there aren't. They're all just the same with different costumes. (flips pages of book to show that every character has the same ugly face and pose)

Person in Line 4: I didn't realize it was that kind of game.

Rigby: Nobody knows what kind of game it is.

Mordecai: Is it medieval? Sci-fi? Western?

Clerk: It's a role-playing game! (everyone walks away) You have to use your imagination! Ugh! (walks away)

Rigby: That's right! Go get us our refund!

(The clerk nails a sign to the wall. It reads: "25% off The Realm of Darthon")

Passerby: No way! (everyone comes to the store because of the sign)

Mordecai: Dude. This campaign is just getting started.

(We begin a montage of M&R discouraging the other people from buying TRoD. M&R first show two people that the stand must be set up, and that setting it up can be dangerous, making them shake their heads and walk away. The clerk gets angry and makes the game 50% off. Then, Rigby shows the people in line that the 50-sided die is only 48-sided. The people in line walk away again as the clerk watches and makes the game 75% off. Mordecai then shows the people in line how excessively long the gameboard is. The people walk away yet again, making the clerk having to sell the game for 100% off with purchase of gum. One person purchases gum and gets the game, but M&R stop the guy to show that the card deck has a joker playing card and a dry cleaning coupon. The person then throws the game against the wall and kicks it a few times before walking off. M&R high-five as the montage concludes.)

Clerk: That's it! (Comes out wearing a cape and a gold helmet, and holding a book) The Realm of Darthon does not suck!

Mordecai: Yeah, but your costume does. (M&R laugh)

(The clerk pants heavily before an aura surrounds him while he holds the book to his face, exposing his skull)

Clerk: (demonically) No refunds! (The Clerk's face reverts back to normal, but with dilated pupils, as he laughs insanely. M&R scream before we cut to black. Torches light the scene, showing that we are now in a temple. The duo are now in authentic fantasy-like outfits)

Rigby: Dude, check out our costumes.

Mordecai: Yeah! Where are we?

(zoom out. A booming voice echoes through the temple)

Voice: Welcome, to the Realm of Darthon. (pan to the park house) Leave while you still can.

Mordecai: We're not leaving without a refund.

(The scenery around the house goes black as the doors to the way out close.)

Voice: Then come and get it!

(A gate door opens. M&R run into the temple. A noise makes sound somewhere)

Rigby: Did you hear that?

Mordecai: I think it's coming from a-- (manbats come towards M&R) ...head! (they start to swarm around them)

Rigby: Aaagh! What are these things?

Mordecai: Ignore it, dude. They're just lame enemies from the game.

Voice: Lame? What do you think of man bats' teamwork? (a big manbat sucks up some manbats in front of him and spits them at M&R, but they slice them all in half with swords)

Rigby: Next time, send enemies that don't blow. (M&R run into a foyer)

Voice: Well, if you didn't like those enemies, then how about some... (appear as said) Mutant jellyfish! Robo-bears! Angry tree people with pixie sorcerers?

(M&R start slicing the enemies, and as they die, they disappear into smoke)

Mordecai: Watch out! (throws a knife that lands into a pixie sorcerer's stomach. Although it dies, M&R are still surrounded) Dude, there are too many of them! (M&R look at each other)

Voice: Come on! Everyone knows technomancers can summon allies.

Mordecai: Rigby!

Rigby: (pushes buttons on keyboard) Summon allies! (three orbs are unleashed into the air. The orbs summon Skips, a warrior, Pops, a cyborg cowboy, and Benson, an elf)

Benson: What the-- (in the BG, M&R are fighting the bad guys) I told you guys I didn't want to play this game.

Mordecai: We need your help!

Rigby: We need the refund from the game master!

Benson: What? (a robo-bear roars, and starts charging towards them. Skips goes over and kills the robo-bear with one swipe of the blade. A bird flies onto his shoulder) When this is over, you two are dead!

(Benson fires an arrow. M&R fend off some formally-dressed jack o'lanterns. Pops pushes buttons on a keyboard, firing a laser at an angry tree person, killing it)

Pops: Oooh! (Laughs while firing lasers at mutant jellyfish. There's still a lot of enemies around them all. Skips kills a jack o'lantern, and Benson fires an arrow at a mutant jellyfish. Pops is still trigger crazy.)

Mordecai: Haha, yeah!

Voice: I changed my mind. Necromancers can't summon allies. (Benson, Pops and Skips disappear)

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: He's just cheating so he can win!

Rigby: Quit chea-- (a pixie sorcerer shoves him in the stomach, pinning him to the ground, and punches Rigby. A mutant jellyfish is stuck to Mordecai)

Voice: I'm not cheating. I'm using my imagination! (Mordecai slices the jellyfish, splitting it into two) That's what makes this game fun!

Mordecai: That's what makes this game blow!

Voice: Enough! (enemies disappear. A light shines) I won't allow you to insult my realm any longer.

(the silhouette of a knight appears into the light, and reveals itself on top of the steps)

Darthon: I am Darthon! (the mace levitates into the air, and its spikes morph into screaming faces that turn into a ghost skeleton) Still think this game blows?

(The ghost flies towards M&R as they scream. Rigby unleashes a lightning bolt from his finger)

Darthon: Lightning bolts have no effect on giant monsters. (the lightning bolt bounces off the ghost. Mordecai throws a bomb) Projectile weapons deal damage to the user! (the bomb morphs into a boomerang and explodes over M&R's heads) Oh no, You stepped in a permafrost puddle! (the ground freezes under M&R's feet, causing them to slip) Players are frozen in place! (ice freezes up to M&R's necks. The ghost is coming towards them)

Rigby: Stay back! (the ghost stops) Self-destruct? (the ghost explodes. M&R look at each other, now realizing the only way to defeat Darthon is to beat him at his own role-playing game - fight magical fire with magical fire, in other words.)

Mordecai: We are not frozen. (the ice around them breaks) Looks like it's our turn.

(The duo start running)

Darthon: Your party is washed away by a flood! (summons a tidal wave)

Mordecai: Our +3 awesomeness repels water. (the wave fails to attack M&R. Darthon screams in anger and summons a fireball)

Rigby: Fireballs are made of kittens! (fireball becomes kittens)

Darthon: Kittens are man-eating tigers! (kittens become tigers)

Mordecai: Man-eating tigers turn into stuffed animals! (tigers become stuffed animals. The stuffed animals run into the duo as they run up the steps)

Darthon: Players lose their weapons when running! (Mordecai's sword and Rigby's staff fly off)

Mordecai: Warriors carry the Immunity Sword, which is immune to all rule changes! (pulls out sword)

Darthon: W-what?! No! That's not--

(Mordecai stabs Darthon with the Immunity Sword in the chest, beating the Dungeon Master in his own game. Darthon screams in agonized pain)

Mordecai: Now give us our refund.

(Darthon kneels to the ground as we fade to the real world. It turns out Darthon was the clerk)

Mordecai and Rigby: Haha! Yeah, we did it! (the clerk groans. It turns out the immunity sword was a ruler)

Mordecai: Dude, are you okay?

Clerk: Yeah. I'm fine. Here's your refund. (pulls out the money)

Mordecai: No, it's cool. You should keep it.

Clerk: No, no. You beat me fair and square. (hands Rigby the money)

Rigby: Are you sure you're alright?

Mordecai: Yeah. We can take you to the hospital.

Clerk: No. No. I'm fine. (gets in car) I just need an icepack. (struggles to get seatbelt in) I... just... gotta... I gotta go up and lay down for a bit. (drives off. Benson, Pops and Skips walk up)

Pops: Mordecai! Rigby!

Mordecai: Pops! Where have you guys been?

Benson: We were hiding in the armor closet, then suddenly, we were in the stock room at Shoe Farm.

Rigby: (pulls out money) Good thing it was worth it! (shakes money) Seven bones, baby!

Benson: Seven dollars?! We almost died for seven dollars?!

Rigby: The numbers aren't important.

Mordecai: It was the principle.

Rigby: Yeah. If we're gonna spend that kind of money, it's gotta be on a cool game.

Mordecai: Yeah. Something like Trail of Elderich or The Lair of Anthalon.

Rigby: Dude, Is that out?

Mordecai: Yeah. It came out last week.

(M&R run into the store)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeayuh!

Mordecai: Augh! This is the worst.

Rigby: I don't know, I kind of like it up here. The world seems different at this height. It makes me feel like a giant! (Roars)

Mordecai: What? Look, we're not up here to enjoy the view, so will you just come and help me clean these gutters?

Rigby: I'm helping, I'm holding the hose. Look, I'm taking a giant leak. (Positions the hose to his crotch, turns it on and pretends to pee) Ohhhhh.

Mordecai: Yeah, well, you don't need those gloves to hold the hose. (holds up hands) Look at this dude. Come on, let me wear them!

Rigby: Sorry man, you should have thought about that before you threw paper, and lost to my scissors.

Mordecai: Augh! Whatever, dude. Just hose this stuff off.

(Rigby hoses the leaves out of the gutter. A cassette tape is launched into the air and hits Mordecai in the head)

Mordecai: Agh! (Tape falls to the ground) What the heck?!

Rigby: Uh, sorry man.

Mordecai: (Picks up tape) Weird, it's a tape. Wonder what it's doing up in the gutter.

Rigby: Maybe it fell out of a plane.

Mordecai: Nah, it's probably just trash. I wanna see how far I can chuck it.

Rigby: Wait!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Don't you wanna see what band it is?

Mordecai: Oh, okay. (wipes dirt off of tape to reveal the words "Solid Bold") Solid Bold? Augh, it's that single of that summertime song.

Rigby: "Summertime Loving: Loving in the Summer (Time)"? (Mordecai looks at the tape. It says exactly what Rigby said)

Mordecai: Yeah.

Rigby: Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (grabs tape) Aw, this is my jam right here!

Mordecai: (annoyed) What? This song sucks.

Rigby: Nah, you were all into it too, I remember.

Mordecai: Yeah, just for that one summer in junior high and then I realized how lame it was.

Rigby: Whatever, man. Once we pop this into the stereo, all the good memories will come flooding back, and you'll see. You'll see who's jam it is.

Mordecai: (annoyed) I'm not listening to that trash.

Rigby: You need to get your mind out of these gutters, and into the summer.

Mordecai: Fine, but only because I want to take a break.

(Cut to Rigby putting tape in the stereo. The song starts)

Singer: It's summertime, and you know what that means. Gonna head down to the beach, gonna do some beachy things. It's summertime and it feels just right.

Rigby: Yea-uh!

Singer: Gonna gather all my friends and we'll party through the night. It's summertime, lo-o-ovin'. Lovin' in the summertime. (It's summertime) Summertime lo-o-ovin'. Baby, why can't you be mine?

Rigby: Okay, this song's lame.

Mordecai: (uninterested) I told you, man.

Singer: Summertime...

(Rigby ejects tape and throws tape into garbage)

Rigby: Man, I guess some stuff just doesn't hold on.

Mordecai: Now you're making sense, and now I'm making snacks.

(cut to Mordecai and Rigby eating sandwiches)

Rigby: It's summertime... (eats sandwich) Lo-o-ovin'... (eats again) Loving in the summertime.

Mordecai: (confused) What are you doing?

Rigby: (oblivious)What?

Mordecai: You're singing that song.

Rigby: (surprised) I am?

Mordecai: (now annoyed) Yes, please stop. It's annoying.

Rigby: I guess it's pretty catchy.

(Rigby confusedly eats his sandwich. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby cleaning the gutters. Rigby takes a leak like before)

Rigby: Summertime lo-o-ovin'. Baby, why can't you be mi-

Mordecai: Dude!

(cut to Mordecai and Rigby watching television. Rigby still singing.)

Rigby: Gonna head down to the beach, gonna do some beachy things.

Mordecai: Dude!

(cut to Mordecai and Rigby walking in the park, Rigby sings again, however, Mordecai is annoyed by this song, unable to take it anymore.)

Rigby: It's summertime lo-o-o-

Mordecai: (blows up in annoyance) Dude! Quit it!

Rigby: I'm sorry, I can't help it, it's stuck in my head, and I can't get it out.

Mordecai: Well, for my sanity and yours, we gotta get that song outta there.

Rigby: Yeah, okay.

(clock transition to Mordecai and Rigby in their room)

Mordecai: Okay, okay. I've got the perfect solution: Brain Explosion.

Rigby: What? You can't explode my brain. That's gotta be illegal.

Mordecai: (holds up CD) No, the band, Brain Explosion.

Rigby: Oh, never heard of them.

Mordecai: Yeah, I know, you wouldn't have. You gotta be in the know to know, you know.

Rigby: No.

Mordecai: And that's why you've never heard of them. But trust me, these guys are like real, real musicians. Just listen to some of this, and It will throw that poppy trash music right out of your head. (puts CD in stereo)

[CD plays a triphoppy song]

Mordecai: Wait, wait... Aw man, that's like the best part. [glares at Rigby sleeping] Rigby!

Rigby: [startles] Lovin' in the summertime. What? Ah, I think your song just put me to sleep.

Mordecai: [turns stereo off] Man, you have no taste in music.

Rigby: Look, all I know is that this song is still stuck in my head.

Mordecai: Alright, well, what if we sit down and listen to the entire summertime song beginning to end. [retrieves summertime casette from trash] That way your brain'll have closure and then it can move on. [puts casette into stereo]

Singer: It's summertime and you know what that means. Gonna head down to the beach, gonna do some beachy things.

Mordecai: [walks out of room] I can't stand this, I'm gonna wait outside.

Singer: It's summertime and it feels just right. gonna gather all my friends and we'll party through the night...

[Timeskip where Rigby is sitting on the bed, song is still playing]

Singer: Summertime lo-o-ovin'. Baby, why can't you be mine?

[Timeskip where Rigby is lying against the nightstand, song is still playing]

Singer: Summertime lo-o-ovin'. Lovin' in the summertime.

[Rigby turns tape off, Mordecai opens the door]

Mordecai: Well, did it work?

Rigby: (in the tune of the song) I think it worked, but I can't be sure. So maybe I should listen to the song a little bit more.

Mordecai: Aw, man! It's even worse now. Time to take a different approach.

[Montage of Mordecai and Rigby doing various things to get the song unstuck, like sticking Rigby's head in a toilet, using loud objects and finally Muscle Man hitting Rigby on the head with a broom. Cut to Rigby taking his helmet off]

Rigby: Wait. Stop. Stop. It's not working. The stupid song's still stuck in my head.

Muscle Man: You have a song stuck in your head?

[Rigby throws helmet at Muscle Man, much to his annoyance. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby in their bedroom]

Mordecai: Man, we're running out of options here. Let's see.

[The song starts playing]

Mordecai: Dude, turn it off, I'm trying to think. Dude, stop playing the tape we've already tried- [turns and gasps]

[Rigby is floating with a purple beam coming out of his mouth and pupils dilated. He suddenly goes back to normal and the song stops playing]

Mordecai: Dude, what's wrong with you?!

Rigby: I don't- [floats again, goes back to normal] -know! I can't- [floats again, goes back to normal] -control it! [floats again]

Mordecai: We gotta find Skips.

[Cut to Mordecai and Rigby in Skips' room]

Skips: Yeah, I've seen this before. Hold still. [holds floating Rigby and punches him]

Rigby: Oww! What was that for?!

Skips: You're not thinking about the song anymore, are you?

[Skips and Mordecai laugh]

Rigby: It's not funny- [floats again, goes back to normal] -see and it didn't even work.

Skips: Look, seriously, I don't know what's wrong with you. Just sleep it off, you'll probably forget about it in the morning.

[Cut to Rigby's mind whilst sleeping. The background is empty]

Dream Rigby: Hello? [walks] Hello?

[Large speaker emerges from ground playing the song. Rigby runs and another speaker emerges]

Dream Rigby: Get out, get out! [screams]

[Rigby digs into his ear and pulls out the cassette and throws it far away. He laughs victoriously but suddenly, a giant shadow emerges and runs towards Rigby. Rigby wakes up]

Rigby: The song. It's gone! [runs to Mordecai who is asleep.] Mordecai! Mordecai!

Mordecai: Huh? What's up?

Rigby: The song's not in my head anymore!

Mordecai: That's awesome, dude. Now we never have to hear that dumb song again.

(Suddenly, they hear the song again. Mordecai and Rigby gasp. To Mordecai's and Rigby's horror, they realize that the situation has gone much worse than they thought. Although, they were able to get the casket out of Rigby's head, but now with the cassette free, it manifestated itself into physical form. Now he's large cassette with stick arms and legs and red sunglasses.)

Mordecai: What the heck is that?

(The giant cassette continues to play.)

Rigby: (horrified) I have no idea what I'm looking at.

Mordecai: I think the song must've left your head and manifested itself into a physical form.

Rigby: Well, does it have an "Off" switch?

Mordecai: I don't know.

Rigby: Hey, dancing song dude! Knock it off! Dude, come on, quit it! Seriously, man! I'm sick of this song!

[Cassette drums on Rigby's head]

Rigby: Get off! [tackles cassette and goes right through it] Oh my gosh, it's a ghost tape!

Mordecai: Dude. Calm down. It's not a ghost. It's just music. You can't touch music. But music can touch you.

Rigby: Oh, barf. How do we get rid of it?

Mordecai: I don't know. If we just ignore it, it'll probably just go away.

[Montage of Mordecai and Rigby doing everyday activities with the cassette dancing around them. Everyone, especially Benson, gets annoyed, Benson leaves in annoyance as the others walk away extremely irritated. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby. Unable to stand anymore of this song, the duo are seen going into a room and locking it.]

Mordecai: Dude that's it, we gotta do something about this.

Rigby: What can we do? He's unstoppable!

Mordecai: We gotta fight fire with fire.

Rigby: Dude, hello. Fire's just gonna go right through him.

Mordecai: No dude, we gotta battle him with our own song.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: We're gonna write the cheesiest, most repetitive, catchiest song ever, and we'll see how he likes it.

Rigby: Aw, snap!

Mordecai: And that's the perfect title!

[Cassette comes running down the hall then walks through the wall]

Mordecai: Come on!

[Mordecai and Rigby exit. They run into Pops]

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops!

Mordecai: We need you to distract the "Summertime" Song.

Pops: But I can't stand that song.

Mordecai: I know. We're gonna get rid of it for good. But we need you to buy us some time, so just go dance with him and pretend like you're having fun.

Pops: Alright, then.

Mordecai: Thanks, Pops.

[Mordecai and Rigby run away]

Pops: But I'm not going to use my best dance moves!

[Cassette comes up to Pops. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby opening the garage door and walking up to the keyboard]

Mordecai: Okay, song, song... [plays some notes] Okay, we'll just repeat that. And lyrics, go.

Rigby: Uh, Summertime loving.

Mordecai: No, dude, come on. Give me something I can use. What do you like?

Rigby: Partying.

Mordecai: Yeah, uh huh. Uh huh.

Rigby: Macaroni. Oh, naps! I love naps.

Mordecai: Alright, good enough.

Skips: Okay, I'm here. And I brought my bass.

Mordecai: Wait. How did you...

Skips: I know everything, remember?

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa...

Skips: Nah, I'm just yanking you. I was on the can and I heard your plan.

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugh!

Skips: Let's roll.

[Cut to Pops and the cassette]

Mordecai: (on walkie talkie) Pops, come in, Pops.

Pops: Yes, hello?

Mordecai: I need you to lure the "summertime" song outside, okay?

Pops: Yes, okay. [to the cassette] The party continues this way, my friend.

[Pops and the cassette run down the stairs. Cut to Mordecai, Rigby and Skips setting up]

Mordecai: Okay, get ready guys.

Muscle Man: Wait up! Don't start the party without us, fellas.

Mordecai: Whoa! Muscle Man, you play something?

Skips: Yeah, Muscle Man blows a mean piece of brass.

Muscle Man: Yeah. [plays some notes on his trumpet] And you know who else blows a mean piece of brass?

Rigby: Here they come!

Mordecai: Pops!

[Pops runs to the keyboard]

Rigby: [tapping tambourine] One, two, three, four!

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips and Pops: Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap. Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap. Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap....

[Cassette hits back with sound waves by playing the song. The waves drown them out]

Mordecai: Louder! Come on!

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips and Pops: Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap. Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap.

[Their sound waves knock the cassette over. The cassette shoots a purple beam and they shoot out a green one. Two giant musicians appear in the sky and fight.]

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips and Pops: Aw, snap! [slower] Aw, snap! [more slower] Aw, snap!

[The combined sound waves knock down the Snack Bar and shatter Benson's window. Benson looks out his window and runs out the door. The cassette's giant musician overpowers their giant musician]

Rigby: He's too strong!

Mordecai: No, we can do it!

[Mordecai collapses and sees Benson driving the golf cart towards them]

Mordecai: Oh, shoot! Benson!

Benson: [stops the cart] Unbelievable!

Mordecai: Look Benson, we didn't mean-

Benson: [gets on top of the cart] You guys forgot the most important thing about writing a catchy song. [reveals a drum set on top of the cart]

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

Benson: It's gotta have a beat. [begins drumming impressively]

[Benson taps his drum sticks and they resume playing]

Benson, Mordecai, Rigby, Skips and Pops: Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap.

[Their giant musician begins overpowering the cassette's giant musician.]

Benson, Mordecai, Rigby, Skips and Pops: Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap. Aw, snap!

[Their giant musician smashes the cassette's giant musician, the cassette explodes.]

Mordecai: Man, Benson, that was amazing. I didn't know you could play the drums like that.

Benson: Well, it's a funny story.

Rigby: [pupils dilated] Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap. Aw, snap! Aw, snap! Come to our macaroni party and we'll take a nap.

Everyone except Rigby: (much to their dismay and horror) Nooo!

Rigby: WHOOO! Done! (reveals bush to be square-shaped) In your face, bush! (to Mordecai) Hmph! Hmph! Looks like you've got a waste to go there, guy!

Mordecai: Not as much as Muscle Man over there. (Muscle Man has a huge heap of a hedge to trim) He barely touched that hedge.

(Muscle Man, obviously sad and depressed, tries to cut off a twig from the hedge, but lets go at the last moment and breaks down, crying)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man, we got work to do, remember? (Muscle Man weeps again)

Rigby: Dude, are you crying?

Muscle Man: No! Crying's for ladies, like you! I don't cry!

(Cut to Muscle Man's shower. He is sitting there, crying and naked. Mordecai and Rigby are knocking on his trailer, to no response)

Rigby: Dude, he's been in there for hours.

Mordecai: Muscle Man. Muscle Man! Muscle Man, are you taking a shower so we can't see you crying?

Muscle Man: No! It's... it's just the sound of the water hitting the drain!

Mordecai: Dude, what's wrong with him?

(Hi Five Ghost approaches the trailer)

Hi Five Ghost: His girlfriend, Starla dumped him last night.

Rigby: (surprised) What? Muscle Man had a girlfriend? I wonder who had more junk in the trunk.

Mordecai: Muscle Man, just come out. We can talk about it if you want.

Muscle Man: No! I don't talk about my feelings with anyone! Leave me alone!

Rigby: No use, man. Let's let Benson deal with him.

(Cuts to outside Skips' garage. Benson is talking to Mordecai and Rigby)

Benson: So it's come to my attention that Muscle Man's been dumped. And he can't do his job because, I don't know, he's sad or something. So guess what? You two clowns are gonna pick up his work for today!

Mordecai: Aw, what? I'm always sad.

Rigby: I'm sad right now.

Mordecai: Can we get time off too?

Benson: File a request with human resources.

Rigby: OK, who's the HR guy?

Benson: Me.

Mordecai: So... can we?

Benson: No. OK, let's see what we got here...

(A montage scene begins with fast-paced music)

Benson: Task Number One: Dig out the rotting stumps from the picnic area. Watch out for hornets' nests. (Mordecai and Rigby are wrenching out a stump when a nest of hornets attacks them) Task Number Two: that guy who thinks he's a knight is back. (Brandishing shovels, Mordecai and Rigby are avoiding trash thrown by the knight) He's built a castle out of old mattresses at the creek. Get him out of there! And finally, there's the daily maintenance of the park rock garden. (Mordecai and Rigby are standing on tiny stumps in a manicured sand box, sweeping it carefully.)

Rigby: Augh! This is impossible!

Mordecai: Who knew Muscle Man was responsible for so much stuff? We gotta convince him to start working again.

Rigby: Yeah! Why should we do his work?

Mordecai: Alright, let's do it.

(Mordecai and Rigby jump off the stumps and walk off the sand)

Rigby: I won't miss this job. Raking that sand took...

(They look back and see their hard work ruined by their footprints)

Mordecai and Rigby: Nooooo!

(Cuts to the kitchen in the park house. Muscle Man is at the table eating Muscle Maker 3000 straight out of the jar with a spoon. Mordecai and Rigby enter)

Mordecai: Dude, you gotta snap out of it. Benson is making us do all your work!

Muscle Man: I can't work. I'm busy stuffing my face hole!

Mordecai: Look, I know you're upset, but you gotta move on.

Muscle Man: I'm not upset! I'm... I'm... (Muscle Man breaks down in tears, which soon become high-pitched wails. Mordecai and Rigby watch with eyebrows raised before Mordecai places his wing on Muscle Man's shoulder to comfort him)

Mordecai: Come on, dude. There's plenty of fish in the sea. (Muscle Man gets up and follows them from the room)

(Cuts to the grocery store)

Mordecai: Alright, Muscle Man. Grocery stores have tons of available women.

Muscle Man: I don't know, Mordecai. None of these ladies are as hot as Starla.

Mordecai: Dude, man up! Check this out: that girl is single. (A pretty young woman is pushing a shopping cart nearby)

Muscle Man: How can you tell?

Mordecai: Check out her cart. American cheese singles, a single serving of soup, and who buys one banana? And I don't see a ring on that finger. So what are you waiting for? Go get her!

Muscle Man: (Approaching the young woman) Uh, hey, you're a chick. I was wondering if you wanted to... I can't do this! (Muscle Man rips open his shirt to reveal a STARLA tattoo across his chest) This heart beats for another! (Muscle Man falls to the floor and sobs) Starlaaaaa!

(Cuts back to Muscle Man sitting naked in the shower, crying, as Mordecai and Rigby knock on his trailer door)

Mordecai: Muscle Man. Muscle Man!

Rigby: He's never going to come out. There's no way we can help him.

(Hi Five Ghost appears at Mordecai and Rigby's side)

Hi Five Ghost: There is one way. We gotta get him back together with Starla.

(Cuts to the mall. Mordecai, Rigby, and Hi Five Ghost are outside Icy Hot Jewelry & Apparel)

Mordecai: You sure this is where she works?

(Hi Five Ghost nods and they go inside. The store is filled with girls' t-shirts, earrings, and other accessories)

Rigby: Ugh! Everything is all glittery and girl- oof!

(Not watching where he's going, Rigby walks straight into Starla's boobs and screams in horror)

Starla: Can I help you gentlemen?

Mordecai: Uh, do you know a guy by the name of Muscle Man? Big guy, 'bout your build?

Starla: Yeah, I know him. I dumped that loser.

Mordecai: Yeah, well, he's pretty miserable without you. You should give him another chance.

Starla: Hah! I'm not getting back together with him. That's over now.

(She walks away, but Mordecai looks determined and follows)

Mordecai: Look, I know how Muscle Man can be. He's annoying, he smells, and he pretty much has no common decency for others, but he's still human, and he has feelings. We all do. (Inspirational music starts) We're just fragile beings looking for someone to share something with. To laugh with. To love.

(Starla looks mesmerized and sees Mordecai, looking extra-handsome, in a field of stars, ignoring what he's saying, until...)

Mordecai: ... and that's why I think you should get back together with Muscle Man. Well, I guess we'll be going.

(The trio start to leave, but Starla chases and grabs Mordecai's hand)

Starla: Wait! You. You had such a way with words. Muscle Man never talked to me that way. He didn't like talking about his feelings. But you? You're different.

(Mordecai struggles to release his hand)

Mordecai: Oh... Will you excuse us for a minute?

(The trio go outside the store)

Mordecai: Aw, sick!

Rigby: Ohhhhh! She liked you, she liked you!

Mordecai: Dude, shut up!

Rigby: Dude, you should totally go out with her!

Mordecai: What? Are you serious? I'd rather do Muscle Man's work than date her.

Rigby: Dude, if you just play along with it, you can dump her. Then, she'll go running back to Muscle Man for sure.

Mordecai: Augh! Alright, one date.

(Starla rubs her face and body on the store window, much to Mordecai's disgust)

Rigby: Better make it three or four just to make sure the dumping takes full effect.

Mordecai: Augh! Fine.

(Mordecai goes back inside)

Mordecai: Uh, do you wanna, um, you know, eugh, go...out?

Starla: (throws herself at Mordecai) Yes!

(A montage begins: 1. Starla and Mordecai enjoy tacos from the Taco'Clock truck, Starla gets taco all over her face then accidentally spits it at Mordecai. 2. Mordecai and Rigby are working at the snack bar as Starla bicycles past and blows a kiss, which Mordecai ducks to avoid. 3. Mordecai and Starla attend a baseball game, and as Mordecai tries not to be seen, Starla munches on a turkey leg, before the two of them appear on 'kiss-o-vision on the Jumbotron. Starla tried to kiss Mordecai as he fights her off. 4. At the beach, Starla asks Mordecai to rub lotion on her back and rolls over onto her front. Mordecai sees three names on her back tattooed but scored out: Muscle Man, Steve, and Muscle Man. A fourth name isn't scored out: Mordecai. He runs away and the montage ends)

(Cuts to the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: Dude, did you dump her yet?

Mordecai: No.

Rigby: Come on, man! Get it over with! I don't wanna do Muscle Man's work anymore. I'm exhausted!

Mordecai: I know, I know. I'll dump her.

(Cuts to inside the coffee shop. Mordecai and Starla are eating pie. Starla has a dreamy look in her eyes while Mordecai looks disgusted. Starla licks her lips suggestively, causing Mordecai to choke slightly and drop his fork)

Mordecai: Look, we gotta talk.

Starla: (gasp) You got some pie on your lip. I'll get it off!

(Starla dives across the table and kisses Mordecai in the beak)

Mordecai: Augh, get off of me! (Mordecai pushes Starla away)

Starla: What's wrong, dumplin'?

Mordecai: I'll tell you what's wrong. I don't like you. ("like you" echoes four times) I don't think we should see each other anymore.

(Mordecai gets up and walks out, while Starla sinks onto her stool, depressed)

(Cuts to outside)

Rigby: Dumped?

Mordecai: Dumped.

Rigby: How'd she take it?

Mordecai: Mmm, she took it well.

(A table launches through the glass window of the coffee shop, sending Mordecai and Rigby scattering. An explosion soon follows, and from the wreckage comes a huge, monster version of Starla with bloodshot eyes. It lets out a blood-curdling roar)

Mordecai and Rigby: (screams)

(Mordecai and Rigby run to the golf cart. Mordecai tries to get it to start)

Mordecai: Come on! Come on, come on!

(Starla catches up to the cart and grabs onto the back of it just as Mordecai gets the ignition started)

Rigby: Go! Go!

(The cart weaves down the street as Starla tries to climb to the front)

Mordecai: Hold on!

(Mordecai makes a quick turn and Starla is thrown back onto the road)

Rigby: Yeah, we did it! She just got tr-rashed!

(Starla appears in the side mirror, catching up quickly on foot)

Rigby: Oh no! Go faster! Let's go faster! Step on it!

(Starla barges the cart repeatedly but loses pace as they all enter the park. Here Starla grows to several times her usual height and stamps on the ground, causing ruptures to appear. The cart tumbles down into a pit of lava, with Mordecai and Rigby just leaping from it in the nick of time. Starla follows again, punching the ground to cause another earthquake and destroying dozens of trees. She also destroys the mattress fort down by the creek, causing the man who thinks he's a knight to open a portal to another dimension and escape. Meanwhile the chase continues through the park, destroying the fountain, as Mordecai and Rigby take refuge behind the circus tent)

Rigby: Look out!

(A tree, thrown by Starla, nearly hits Mordecai and Rigby, crushing the tent extension building instead as the duo escape. Starla keeps on throwing trees as a helicopter appears)

Channel 6 News Helicopter Reporter: We're live at the park, where reports of a crazed woman on a rampage...

(Starla launches a boulder at the helicopter. The reporter screams as the helicopter catches fire and plummets to the ground, killing him. Meanwhile, Mordecai and Rigby have made it to Muscle Man's trailer, where they pound the door)

Mordecai: Muscle Man! Your ex's gone crazy and she's wrecking up the park!

(Muscle Man is naked in the shower again)

Muscle Man: Huh?!

Mordecai: Dude, you have to talk to her!

(An approaching appears over Mordecai and Rigby's heads as they gasp in horror. It's Starla, dive-bombing the trailer. The duo dive out of the way just in time. Starla chases them on. Muscle Man, wrapped in a towel, emerges from the trailer bathroom to find his home ripped in half.)

Muscle Man: Starla?

(Cuts to the house. Mordecai and Rigby are inside blocking the door as Starla tries to batter the door down with a streetlight post)

Mordecai: I guess this is it.

(The door comes crashing in and Mordecai and Rigby hit the floor. Starla's eyes are glowing red with fury.)

Starla: Mordecai!

(Mordecai moans in fear, but Muscle Man appears through the hole where the door used to be)

Muscle Man: Babe! I can't stand to see you like this. You gotta stop!

(Starla groans angrily in response)

Muscle Man: Oh... I guess I'll just go.

Mordecai: Dude, Muscle Man! She's right there! Say something to her!

Muscle Man: (nervous mumble) I think you're foxy when you break things.

(Starla groans angrily again)

Mordecai: No! From here. (Mordecai points to his heart)

Muscle Man: (sigh) Starla?

(Starla turns around to face Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: I can understand you're upset. When I look at you, I think of someone I know. Someone who is fragile and vulnerable deep down. Someone who has feelings. That someone is me. Mitch Sorenstein.

Starla: Huh?

Rigby: (chuckles) His name's Mitch?

Muscle Man: I've been so upset since you left me, baby. You're the light of my life. The fire that burns in my heart. The one. Starla. Will you be my Muscle Woman?

Starla: Mitch...? Oh, Mitch!

Muscle Man: Starla!

(Starla and Muscle Man run to each other in slow-motion)

Starla: Miiiiitch!

Muscle Man: Staaaarlaaaa!

(The couple collide into each other in a sea of flab, and we are treated to a close-up of their french kissing.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, sick!

Starla: Aw, Mitch! I've never heard you talk about your feelings before!

Muscle Man: You know who else doesn't like to talk about her feelings? My Mom!

Starla: (laughs) Oh, Mitch! You have the best sense of humor.

(Starla jumps into Muscle Man's arms, and he carries her down the stairs away from the house)

Muscle Man: Aw yeah, baby. You know I love it when you destroy property. (They kiss again)

Mordecai: As much as I wanna vomit right now, those two were made for one another.

Rigby: This was the most disturbing day of my life.

Mordecai: Yeah. Maybe we should have just done Muscle Man's chores.

Mordecai & Rigby: Bam! OOOOOOOOHHH!!!

Rigby: Yeah! Finally done!

Mordecai: Dude. Celebration hug?

Rigby: Yeah, man.

(They approach each other, as if to hug, then they suddenly pull back at the same time)

Mordecai & Rigby: Aw, sick!

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh)

Rigby: Dude, you almost hugged me!

Mordecai: No way! You almost hugged me!

Rigby: We mowed that lawn in its face!

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. Let's go on break.

Rigby: Now you're talking.

(They start to head up, but Benson pulls up in the cart.)

Benson: Hold it!

(Benson takes out a ruler and measures the grass)

Benson: Nope. It's no good.

Mordecai & Rigby: AWW, WHAT?

Benson: It's an inch too tall. Do it again! DO IT ALL AGAIN!!!!!!

(Mordecai and Rigby groan)

Rigby: It's just one inch!

Benson: Would you want to play Ultimate Frisbee in this? A guy could trip, skid, get severe turf rash, and BAM! Lawsuit. Now get to work.

Rigby: But... but... but...

Benson: Oh wait. Is that the sound of somebody who wants to be fired? (Rigby lowers his arms) That's what I thought.

(Benson gets in the cart and drives off. Mordecai picks his mower back up.)

Rigby: I can't re-mow the lawn! I'm a busy guy!

Mordecai: No, you're not.

Rigby: Yeah-huh! I got a meatball sub I gotta eat! My life sucks.

Mordecai: Whatever. It's not like you can hire somebody to do your work while you slack off.

Rigby: "Hire somebody?" (gasps) Duuude. (runs off)

Mordecai: Hey!

(Cut to Rigby putting the finishing touches on a stand. The sign on top says "Dudes Hiring Dudes." Rigby has just finished writing "The Agent Is In" on the lower sign when a shadow falls over him. It's Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Hey, dude. Thanks for bailing on me. What is this?

Rigby: I'm gonna hire a temp.

Mordecai: This sounds like a scam.

Rigby: Hey, if hiring a dude to do all my work and paying them a small part of my paycheck while I go get a meatball sub is a scam, then THIS IS A HUUUUUGE SCAM! (Everyone around walks away) Uhhh...

Mordecai: Hm. Hm. Let me know when you want to stop wasting time.

(Transition to Rigby sitting at the stand some moments later, interviewing Explosives Guy.)

Rigby: So, tell me a little bit about yourself.

Explosives Guy: Uh, I like pyrotechnics. (Fireworks suddenly erupt from his pocket, catching his pants on fire.)

(Jump cut to Rigby interviewing the Pirate and his Parrot)

Rigby: So, what are you good at?

Parrot: Raah! Pyrotechnics! (explodes)

(Jump cut to Rigby interviewing Muscular Redneck)

Rigby: Let me guess, you like pyrotechnics.

Muscular Redneck: No, but I do like this. (pulls out harmonica)

(Muscular Redneck turns around and brings the harmonica up to his rear end. He begins to play the harmonica with his flatulence. Rigby watches in bemusement.) (In the UK, the Redneck shoves a harmonica up his nose and starts sneezing instead.)

Rigby: Alright, alright, that's enough.

(Clock transition to Rigby sitting alone at his stand some time later.)

Rigby: Ugh, man! I can't find one normal person in this town who wants a job! I give up!

(A bus pulls up at a nearby stop. Doug walks off the bus.)

Doug: Well, time to find me a job.

(The bus drives away.)

Rigby: Hey! Hey you! Come here! (Doug walks up to the stand) What's your name?

Doug: Name's Doug, sir. I'm looking for a job.

Rigby: You've come to the right place, Doug. But first, tell me about yourself.

Doug: Well, all my life I've wanted to be somebody. I'm willing to do whatever it takes.

Rigby: Hm. Hm. How are you with mowing lawns?

Doug: Well, I don't mean to be negative, but it looks to me like that grass is an inch too tall.

Rigby: Oh, you're good. Alright, let's get you fitted to your new job.

(Clock transition to Doug mowing the lawn in the park. Rigby is resting beneath a tree nearby.)

Doug: Thank you so much for this job, Mr. Rigby!

(Rigby sighs in relaxation. Mordecai walks up to Rigby, holding an envelope.)

Mordecai: Hey dude, Benson wanted me to give you your weeks pay. (Hands the envelope to Rigby and sees Doug.) Who's that?

Rigby: Oh, that's Doug. He's my new temp.

Mordecai: What? Are you serious?

Rigby: Hey, Dougie! (motions Doug to come to him, who gladly obliges.) Payday!

(Rigby holds the evelope out, but pulls it back just as Doug is about to grab it.)

Rigby: Ah, ah, ah. First, I gotta cover the finder's fee. (Rigby takes a huge majority of his pay, leaving Doug with meager change.) Here you go.

Doug: Wow, this is the most I've ever been paid. Thanks, Mr. Rigby. You're the best boss ever! (He walks off.)

Mordecai: (beat) You make me sick.

(Clock transition to the house, at night. Rigby and Doug enter.)

Doug: Wow, this place is huge!

Rigby: Yeah, it's pretty cool. This way.

(Rigby and Doug enter Mordecai and Rigby's bedroom.)

Rigby: So you'll crash here.

Doug: Woah! (prods the trampoline) On this?

Rigby: No, no, you don't just start with the trampoline. You gotta pay your dues. (they head over to the closet) This is where you'll be sleeping. (opens the closet)

Doug: (gasps in awe)

Rigby: There's some socks in case you get cold.

Doug: My own bed! Rigby...wow, Rigby. If you don't mind me saying, you're the best boss I've ever had!

Rigby: You know what, Doug? I think this is gonna work out just fine!

(Clock transition to Mordecai and Doug raking the lawn. Rigby is relaxing beneath a tree nearby.)

Rigby: I'm tired, I'm taking a break. (gets up) Keep it shakin' with the rakin' there, guys. (he leaves)

Mordecai: (mocking) "Keep it shakin' with the rakin' there, guys."

Doug: (laughs) Nice impression there, Mordecai. Listen to this one. (In Rigby's voice) Keep it shakin' with the rakin' there, guys.

Mordecai: (laughs) Dude, that sounds just like him! (laughs)

(Rigby enters with a meatball sub sandwich)

Rigby: What's so funny?

Mordecai: Dude, Doug is hilarious. Check out his impression of you!

Doug: (In Rigby's voice) Hi, I'm Rigby, and I got me a meatball sub!

(Doug and Mordecai laugh. Rigby isn't amused.)

Rigby: I...I don't sound like that.

Mordecai: Dude, it's like, dead-on!

Doug: (In Rigby's voice) Hello, I'm, Rigby! Nice to meet you!

(Mordecai and Doug laugh.)

Rigby: Grrr...

(Clock transition to Mordecai eating in the kitchen of the house. Rigby enters.)

Rigby: Dude, that wasn't cool!

Mordecai: Haha, you should've seen your face!

Rigby: Dude, impressions are the lowest form of comedy. (Poor impression of Doug's voice) "Hey, I'm Doug! I'm easily impressed because I have a small brain!" See? It's easy to copy somebody else.

(Doug enters.)

Mordecai: Yo, Doug-ay!

Doug: Hey, fellas! (he shakes hands with Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Ready for some hoops?

Doug: Oh, you know it!

(Mordecai and Doug start to leave.)

Rigby: Uh, wait! Can I come along, too?

Mordecai: Oh...well, it's kind of a two-on-two rematch. Sorry, dude.

(Mordecai and Doug exit.)

(Clock transition to Rigby sitting alone in the playground, watching Mordecai, Doug, Muscle Man and Hi Five ghost playing basketball.)

Hi Five Ghost: Cover him!

Muscle Man: I got this fool!

Mordecai: Over here, over here!

Doug: From downtown! (he shoots and scores) Boom-shaka-laka!

Mordecai: Yeah-yuh!

Rigby: Pff, I could've done that.

(Doug removes his hat and combs his hair with his hand, causing it to stand upright like Rigby's.)

Rigby: (gasps) Hey, that's my haircut!

(Clock transition to the snack bar. Mordecai works the register while Doug cooks.)

Customer: Two hot dogs, please.

Mordecai: Yo Doug, I need some dogs over here!

Doug: Dogs from my dog! (he launches the hot dogs towards Mordecai, who's already prepared with hot dog buns.)

Mordecai: I got 'em, I got 'em! (he catches the hot dogs in each bun.) Uh, ooh! (slams the hot dogs onto the customer's tray) Baam! (to Doug) Way to throw 'em!

Doug: Way to catch 'em!

(they high-five)

Doug: Yeah!

Mordecai: Yeah-uh! (walks back to the register) Alright, who else wants some dogs? (Rigby, inside a nearby garbage can, opens up the lid and peeks out.)

Rigby: That's probably not as fun as it looks.

(Doug then props up his tail in the same manner that Rigby does.)

Rigby: (gasps) He's holding up his tail just like me!

(Clock transition to Rigby peeking out from behind a tree. Mordecai and Doug are cleaning up a littered area of the park.)

Mordecai: Dude, I love working with you, man! We make a great team.

Doug: Yeah, man. That's just me. I love working hard, know what I'm saying? I guess Rigby's just kinda...

Mordecai: What?

Doug: Uh, I shouldn't say anything.

Mordecai: Go ahead, You can say it!

Doug: Rigby's kinda lazy.

Mordecai: Yeeaah, he is! (they laugh.)

Rigby: Grr...

(Benson enters)

Benson: Hey guys, I wanted to come by and thank you. Ultimate Frisbee was a great success. Everybody loved it. Kudos Mordecai. (to Doug) You too, Rigby. See ya. (he leaves)

Mordecai: Later.

Doug: Yeah, see ya... (He turns around, revealing dark rings around his eyes, just like Rigby's.) ...Benson.

Rigby: No! (gasps in terror)

(Jump cut to Mordecai playing a video game in the house. Rigby enters.)

Rigby: Dude, Doug is creeping me out. I think I gotta fire him.

Mordecai: What? Doug's actually pretty cool.

Rigby: He's totally copying me.

Mordecai: Dude, you're being paranoid.

Rigby: Are you kidding me? The dark circles around his eyes, the lovable scoundrel shtick? CLASSIC RIGBY!!!

Mordecai: He probably has his rings around his eyes because he's working all the time.

Rigby: Whatever, man, just give me my paycheck so I can pay him to get out of here.

Mordecai: Pfft, nice try.

Rigby: What are you talking about?

Mordecai: I gave it to you two hours ago.

Rigby: (eyes widen) What?! Where's Doug?!

Mordecai: Upstairs.

Rigby: (runs upstairs) That's it! He's finished! (Begins slamming on bathroom door.) DOUG!!! DOUG DOUG DOUG!!!

(The door opens and shrouds of steam pour out. Doug exits the bathroom, drying himself with a towel.)

Doug: Oh, hey, Rigby.

Rigby: Doug, give me my paycheck!

Doug: Paycheck? Oh...(takes out envelope)...oh, you mean this one? Sure, take it. (He begins to hand the envelope to Rigby, but takes it back at the last second.) Ah, ah, ah. Gotta cover the finder's fee, remember?

Rigby: Grr! Doug, this has gone too far! You're fired!

Doug: Fired? You can't fire me. This is the best job I've ever had. I'm finally becoming somebody. Besides...(in Rigby's voice) I'm more Rigby than you ever were...or will be...

(Doug grabs Rigby by the throat and strangles him. He then transforms into a perfect doppelganger of Rigby. Rigby gasps in horror as Doug laughs maniacally. The two grapple with each other and fight. They eventually roll down the stairs.)

Rigby #1: I'm...Rigby!

Rigby #2: NO! I'm Rigby!

Mordecai: Rigby!

Both Rigbys: WHAT?!

Mordecai: (transfixed) ...Whoa.

(Clock transition to the two Rigbys in the park.)

Rigby #1: I'm Rigby!

Rigby #2: No, I'm Rigby!

Skips: Hmm. (he inspects their faces for a moment, and then turns to face Benson, Mordecai and Pops) Yeah, I can't tell who's who.

Benson: There's only one way to solve this. Alright, I'm gonna have you do a couple of things and ask some questions. Whoever gets them right is the real Rigby, and whoever doesn't, I'm calling the cops.

(Clock transition to both Rigbys weakly punching Mordecai.)

Mordecai: They both can't punch very hard. (he punches both Rigbys, making them fall over and whimper.) They both can't take a punch.

(Cut to the Rigbys playing a video game.)

Video Game: Ultimate fail.

Mordecai: They're both horrible at video games.

(Cut to the Rigbys mopping the floor. They both fall over from laziness.)

Benson: They're both equally lazy.

(Cut to the Rigbys, Benson, Mordecai and Pops back in the park.)

Benson: Okay, how does Rigby like his BLTs?

Rigby #2: No lettuce, no tomatoes, hold the bread and double the bacon.

(Mordecai nods)

Benson: Correct. What did Rigby get for Pops' birthday?

Rigby #1: Easy, nothing.

Pops: Oh, it's true! T'was the best nothing I ever received.

Both Rigbys: (to each other) Hm. Hm. Hm.

Benson: Rigby's high score in Strong John?

Rigby #1: Three!

Benson: Favorite cereal?

Rigby #2: Sugar-frosted marshmallow clusters.

Benson: Rigby's greatest fear?

(Both Rigbys are hesitant to answer.)

Benson: Well?

Rigby #2: Amusement park mascots!

Benson: Yep, you're Rigby.

(Rigby #2 approaches Mordecai)

Mordecai: Hey, dude. Celebratory hug?

Rigby #2: Yeah, man. (they hug.)

Rigby #1: Fine, fine! You guys wanna hang out with him? Go ahead! See if I care! I just hope next time you think twice about choosing a total impostor over your best friend, Mordecai...

Mordecai: Wait! (points to Rigby #1) That's Rigby.

Rigby#1: Huh? But-

Mordecai: I knew it was you, dude.

Rigby#1: What?! But why didn't you say anything?!

Mordecai: Heh, I just wanted to mess with you. Only the real Rigby whines that much.

Rigby: Hah! In your FACE, Doug!

Mordecai: Plus, the real Rigby would never hug me.

(Everyone gets ready to tackle Doug.)

Doug: Uh... (he bolts off, but Skips tackles him and pins him down. Accepting defeat, Doug transforms back into his normal self.)

(Transition to outside of Pops' House. The police have arrived and have taped off a portion of the park. A Detective is talking to the whole group.)

Detective: Yeah, the perps full name is Doug "The Doppelganger" Shablowski. He's been pulling this scam all over the country, but thanks to you, he can be brought to justice. (he leaves.)

Mordecai: (points offscreen) Here he comes!

(Doug, handcuffed and being escorted by two police officers, walks by the group.)

Doug: (in his actual voice) Hey, hold on a sec, I got something to say. Rigby, I want you to know...a guy like me? Ain't got a lot to be thankful for. But you? You got friends, a job, a nice warm bed...you got a good thing going here. Never forget that.

Policeman: Okay! Move it along! (The policeman and Doug enter a police car and leave.)

Rigby: Wow, what a windbag. I thought he'd never shut up. I can't believe you guys thought Doug was me. You must feel like idiots, am I right? (Mordecai and Benson are not amused. Benson begins to shake with rage) ...Uh, right?

Benson: (turning red) I'm the only one around here who hires and fires, so if you really don't wanna do your own job, I'd be glad to accommodate you. Otherwise, you're on toilet duty for the next THREE MONTHS!!!!!!!!! Unbelievable! (He leaves.)

Rigby: Hey Mordecai, wanna make an easy ten bucks?

Mordecai: Man, how can people be so lazy? There are trash cans, like, everywhere.

Rigby: Maybe they didn't see 'em.

Mordecai: What? You're defending these people? I suppose you enjoy being stuck out here cleaning up all this?

Rigby: Yeah, 'cause I found these. (Holds up tiny, bronze-colored shoes)

Mordecai: Whoa. Wait, what are you going to do with bronze baby shoes?

Rigby: I don't know, I'll think of something.

Mordecai: Wait, are you just filling your bag with cool stuff you find?

Rigby: Yeah, man. People leave all sorts of junk here. You just gotta look.

Mordecai: Man, I didn't even think to look. All I got is trash. (Dumps the trash onto the ground. Mordecai then sees a plastic army figure on the ground and picks it up with the stick) Yeah-yuh! (holds up figure) Army dude.

Rigby: See? It's true what they say. One man's trash is another man's pleasure.

Mordecai: Treasure.

Rigby: (Confused) What?

Mordecai: One man's trash is another man's treasure, not pleasure. That's just weird.

Rigby: Well, it's a pleasure to find treasure, so same-diff.

Mordecai: Whatever.

(M&R realize that there is a quarter on the ground. We hear its jingle, before:)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Gasp) Quarter!

Mordecai: Jinx!

Rigby: (Picks up quarter) Yeah, this treasure's my pleasure! (Mordecai punches Rigby in the arm) Hey! (Mordecai does another punch to him)

Mordecai: I said "jinx," dude. You're jinxed.

Rigby: Fine! You can have the quarter. Geez. (Another punch) Du-- (Mordecai raises his fist, then, Rigby quickly covers his mouth)

Mordecai: You know how this works, man. You can't talk when you're jinxed. And if you talk, you're gonna get punched. So keep your mouth shut.

Rigby: Fine. (Another punch) Owww!

(Clock transition to a montage of the game continuing. M&R are playing some video game, and Rigby succeeds)

Rigby: Ohhhh! In your face! (Mordecai punches Rigby once more, and goes back to playing before we cut to a scene with M&R wearing sunglasses)

Mordecai: Whoa! Look, dude! (A solar eclipse is occuring)

Rigby: That's amazing. (Another punch. This one sends Rigby to the ground, but he continues to watch the moon cover the sun entirely) So... beautiful. (Another punch) Ow!

(Cut to Rigby in the bedroom, reading a book. Mordecai enters with an open box)

Mordecai: Dude, check out what came for you in the mail.

Rigby: Aw, yeah! (Runs over and looks in the box) What is it? (It's a sucker punch from Mordecai, right through the box. Rigby's utterings continue:) Totally. (Punch) Nice. (Punch) Come on! (Punch) Can you pass the-- (Mordecai punches Rigby again, knocking his bowl of cereal over) GWAH! (Angrily slams the table, stands up, about to yell something, but catches himself)

Mordecai: What? What is it? You can tell me anything, dude. (Rigby growls and sits back down) Dude, you know you can just break the jinx by having someone say your name three times. (Rigby seems surprised) Wait, I didn't tell you that? (Rigby's surprise turns to anger) Hm, I guess I didn't 'cause everybody knows that. I was wondering why you didn't break it sooner. (Rigby runs off) Better keep your mouth shut, 'cause I'll be listening!

(Cut to an annoyed Benson, observing the still-present trash on the ground)

Benson: Of course all of this trash would still be here. Why do I even try? (Hears Rigby's footsteps) Hey, hey! Get over here right now!

(Rigby, thinking he's found a getaway, runs up to Benson)

Rigby: Benson! Hey man, I need you--

Benson: No. Stop. Don't say anything. (Points out trash) What is this? You guys expect me to let this slide?

Rigby: No. Yes. I don't know. Look, I just need you--

Benson: Uh, what you need? Well, what I need is for you to start cleaning this up right now, or you're fired!

Rigby: Okay, okay. I'm doing it. But can you just say my name three-- (Sees Mordecai behind a tree)

Benson: What? Say your name? (Mordecai raises fist) Why do you want me to say your name? (Turns to see Mordecai) What, what are you looking at? (Sees him and Mordecai runs away) Is that Mordecai? (Tries to get Mordecai's attention) Mordecai! Mordecai, get over here this second or you're fired! (Rigby throws a can of soda at Benson's head, getting his attention) What the heck, Rigby?! What's the matter with you?! (Seeing the open door, Rigby throws another can of soda at Benson) Agh! Rigby!

(Rigby throws the rest of the trash. Benson then throws a temper tantrum. Screaming, he pounds the ground, then, he goes over to the cart, throws a can of compost up into the air, and when it falls, he kicks it, still screaming. Rigby looks on)

Rigby: Just say my name one more time!

(Sees Moredcai next to him)

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm! Hm! (Another punch)

(Scene changes to the park water fountain where Pops is looking at his reflection in the water)

Pops: (Laughing)

(Rigby appears and shakes Pops)

Pops: Oh, hello. (Rigby trys to tell Pops that he's jinxed, but he can't talk, so he tries charades) (Gasps) Are we playing charades? Good show! I just adore parlor games. Next we can play Bits and Bobbles. (Rigby grunts) Okay, yes, I'm getting ahead of myself. Go, go!

(Rigby points to Pops and pats his chest)

Pops: Friends till the end.

(He gets it wrong and Rigby does it again)

Pops: Oh, dirty raccoon.

(Rigby grunts, then points to three of his fingers and pats his chest)

Pops: Three dirty raccoons?

(Rigby grunts and holds up three fingers)

Pops: Raccoons' brains are three times smaller than normal.

(Rigby gets mad and holds up three fingers and shakes his wrist)

Pops: No, uh... Three out of three raccoons can't read.

(Rigby groans and Mordecai walks up)

Pops: Oh, Mordecai, have you come to play charades with us?

Mordecai: Not if this guy is giving the clues, he blows at this game. Pops is never gonna get it. No offense, Pops.

Pops: Oh, none taken. I agree, he's terrible.

Rigby: (Growls) Shut up! I'm good!

(Mordecai punches Rigby)

Pops: Oh, he's jinxed!

Mordecai: Haha, yes, you got it, Pops!

Pops: Oh, I love a good jinxing.

(Rigby groans and runs to Skips' house. He opens the door and runs to a meditating Skips.)

Skips: What do you want? I'm in the middle of something.

(Rigby grabs a piece of paper, writes on it, and shows him the paper, which says, "I'm jinxed. Say my name 3 times!")

Skips: You know, for some people, writing is talking, so you're kinda breaking the rules.

(Skips punches Rigby)

Rigby: Agh! Aw, I didn't even say anything.

(Mordecai punches Rigby)

Mordecai: That's what you get for cheating.

Skips: Sounds count too, right?

Mordecai: Sounds totally count.

Rigby: Sounds count?

(Skips and Mordecai punch Rigby with both fists. Rigby whines and runs away while Mordecai and Skips laugh)

Mordecai: Do you wanna follow him?

Skips: Yeah, why not? I'm not doing anything right now.

(Skips gets up and they walk towards the door. The scene changes to Rigby running to look for someone to unjinx him)

Rigby: Gotta find somebody, gotta find somebody!

(Sees Hi Five Ghost coming the other way and stops)

Rigby: Fives! You gotta help me, man! You gotta say my name three times!

(Hi Five Ghost looks at him unhappily, not saying anything)

Rigby: I'm jinxed, and Mordecai's taking this way too far! You gotta say my name three times!

(Hi Five shakes his head 'no')

Rigby: Come on!

(Hi Five Ghost is still shaking his head 'no')

Rigby: (Whining) Why not?!

Hi Five Ghost: Because I'm jinxed, too.

(Muscle Man comes out from the bushes and punches Fives to the ground)

Muscle Man: Aha! No talking while you're jinxed, loser.

Hi Five Ghost: (Weakly) Help...me...

(Muscle Man punches Hi Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Shut your mouth!

Rigby: Hi Five Ghost, Hi Five Ghost, Hi Five Ghost!

Muscle Man: Hey!

Hi Five Ghost: (Gets up and laughs) Whoo!

Rigby: Dude, help me back!

(Hi Five Ghost leaves)

Rigby: No, wait!

Muscle Man: Dude, what'ya do that for?

Rigby: I'm sorry, I just needed to get rid of my jinx.

Muscle Man: Why don't you take it off yourself?

Rigby: You can do that?

Muscle Man: Pbtt, yeah, it's easy. Now, here's what you gotta do.

(Muscle Man starts whispering something to Rigby, Rigby runs away, then Muscle Man laughs.)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man, have you seen Rigby?

Muscle Man: Yeah. I just told that loser how to unjinx himself.

Skips: You didn't tell him about the mirror thing, did ya?

Muscle Man: Yeah, I did. He's just gonna be talking to himself in the dark. It'll be hilarious!

(Muscle Man laughs)

Skips: We gotta stop him.

(Rigby is seen running towards the men's bathroom. When he gets there, he locks the door, turns off the light, walks to the mirror, and turns the hot water on all of the sinks, causing the mirror to fog up. He's about to write on the mirror when he hears Mordecai knocking on the door.)

Mordecai: Dude, open up! Come on, let us in!

Rigby: No way, man. You guys are just gonna hit me again.

Mordecai: We won't, I swear. (Off-screen) You just gotta come out here and we'll break the jinx.

Rigby: Just break it now, then.

Skips: (Off-screen) That's not how it works. It's gotta happen face to face.

(Rigby groans and walks back to the mirror)

Mordecai: No, dude! Muscle Man doesn't know what he's talking about! Come out of there, you idiot! Rigby!

(Ignoring Mordecai's knocking, Rigby continues to write his name on the mirror and sees that everything he writes on the mirror becomes backwards above it)

Rigby: Whoa... (Writes the rest of his name and stands back) Rigby...

(Lightning is heard and a dark figure is seen in the mirror)

Rigby: Rigby.....

(Lightning is heard again and the dark figure is seen again)

Rigby: Rigby.

(Purple eyes are seen and Ybgir comes out of the mirror, trying to scratch Rigby. Rigby avoids the attack and runs to the sinks, panting. Ybgir growls, making Rigby scream. Ybgir attacks again, disconnecting a sink from the wall as Rigby runs into a stall. In it, a man is seen reading on the toilet.)

Man: Do you mind? I'm trying to get some reading done.

(Rigby gets out of the stall, sees Ybgir, and runs while Ybgir breaks the stall and sees the man)

Mordecai: Rigby, open up! Rigby!

(Rigby runs out of the bathroom screaming, then trips. The man is seen thrown through the roof of the restroom and lands on the ground while Skips, Mordecai, and Rigby scream. Three long scratches are shown on the man's back.)

Skips: That guy's dead.

(The man is gets up and transforms into a demon werewolf, similar to Ybgir. He turns around and growls at them)

Mordecai: That guy's not dead.

(Ybgir then crashes through the wall of the restroom, stands next to the demon man and Skips, Mordecai, and Rigby scream. They run away as Ybgir chases after them and scratches people that are in it's path, transforming them into demons; scene then goes to Muscle Man chasing Hi Five Ghost)

Muscle Man: Come back here! I'm not done with you yet!

(Ybgir then scratches Muscle Man)

HI Five Ghost: Muscle Man!

(Muscle Man then turns into a demon werewolf and continues chasing after HI Five Ghost; scene goes to Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips running)

Mordecai: Dude, what is that thing? It's like you, but evil!

(Scene then goes to Benson cleaning up litter)

Benson: Ugh, can't believe I have-

(Sees Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips running towards the golf cart)

Benson: There you are! Get over here and-

(Mordecai, Rigby, and Skips get into the golf cart)

Rigby: Come with us, Benson!

Benson: What?! I'm not going anywhere until-

(Ybgir comes and scratches Benson)

Rigby: Benson!

Skips: Step on it!

(Mordecai speeds away while Ybgir chases them)

Mordecai: Skips, do you know what we're supposed to do?

Skips: I've seen this before. You gotta-

(Ybgir catches up to them, grabs Skips' leg and yanks him off the cart)

Skips: No!

Mordecai and Rigby: Skips!

Rigby: Jinx!

Mordecai: (Punches Rigby) Shut up! Wait, maybe the monster will go away if I un-jinx you.

(A bunch of demon werewolves are seen in front of the golf cart's path)

Rigby: Stop!

(Mordecai steps on the brakes)

Mordecai: It's Pops!

(Pops is seen being held hostage by the demon werewolves)

Pops: Where are you taking me? I demand you put me down at once.

(A demon werewolf sees Mordecai and Rigby and growls at them, making Mordecai and Rigby scream while the other demon werewolves walk towards them)

Rigby: They see us! Go, go, go, go!

(Mordecai steps on the gas pedal and they speed away from the demon werewolves)

Rigby: You gotta do it now, man! You gotta unjinx me!

Mordecai: Alright. Rigby, Rigby, Rigby! (Rigby tenses, then relaxes) Did it work?

(Rigby looks behind them and sees no one)

Rigby: I think so.

(Mordecai screams as Ybgir jumps out of the trees and in front of him and Rigby. He then turns the cart away from Ybgir)

Mordecai: I thought you said it worked!

Rigby: We're gonna die!

Mordecai: Dude, calm down. Think: what happened while you were in the bathroom?

Rigby: I said my name three times and that thing came out of the mirror!

Mordecai: What else? What else?

Rigby: I locked the door, turned on the water, shut off the light...

Mordecai: The mirror! We gotta get back to that mirror!

(Mordecai turns the cart around and they speed towards the restrooms. They run inside and Mordecai locks the door)

Rigby: I don't think that's gonna help, man!

Mordecai: Wha..?

(Sees the huge hole in the wall and Ybgir hops in front of it. It howls, calling the rest of the demon werewolves to walk towards the restroom)

Mordecai: Oh, man. Do it, dude, do it!

Rigby: (Looking at the mirror) Rigby, Rigby, Rigby! (Bangs on the mirror) Come on! 

Mordecai: They're still coming! Together!

(Mordecai runs to the mirror)

Mordecai and Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

(They turn around and see a demonized Benson, Pops, and Skips entering the hole. Ybgir jumps through the hole in the ceiling, howls, and lands in the restroom)

Mordecai and Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby! Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

(They bang the mirror and Ybgir is seen running towards them)

Mordecai: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

Mordecai and Rigby: Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby, Rigby!

(Their breath creates a fog on the mirror which reveals Rigby's and Ybgir's names)

Mordecai: (Gasps) His name's in reverse.

(Ybgir is still seen running and is getting closer to Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ybgir, Ybgir, Ybgir!

(The scene goes to slow-motion as Ybgir jumps, about to scratch a scared Mordecai and Rigby, when a portal is seen opening in the mirror; Ybgir gets sucked into the portal and a white screen is shown for a second. Back into daylight,Mordecai and Rigby walk outside and find the scratched victims in their underwear, confused on what just happened)

Benson: Mordecai, Rigby! You two are in so much trouble!

Mordecai and Rigby: Hey, Benson.

Mordecai: Look Benson, I can totally explain.

Benson: I don't wanna hear it. I wanted that trash picked up hours ago.

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Mordecai: We're sorry, Benson.

Rigby: Yeah, we'll do it right away.

(Benson is about to say something, but stops himself)

Benson: Well, alright.

(Benson walks away)

Rigby: Hey, look.

(Pops, Muscle Man, and Hi Five Ghost are seen and Pops and Muscle Man are shirtless)

Pops: How on earth did I get here?

Muscle Man: Ugh, my head...

Pops: Has anyone seen my hat?

(Skips is seen skiping up to Mordecai and Rigby)

Skips: Looks like you guys are off the hook. Nobody remembers anything.

Mordecai: How come you haven't lost your memory?

Skips: My mind's a steal trap. And don't do that again.

(Skips skips away)

Mordecai and Rigby: We won't.

Rigby: Jinx, haha!

Mordecai: Uh, eh, whatever.

(Rigby starts punching Mordecai)

Rigby: No talking while you're jinxed! (Grunts 'repeatedly) How do you like it?! (Realizing his punches don't affect Mordecai) How do...you...like...it...?

Mordecai: I feel bad for you that you'll never be able to fully enjoy this game.

Mordecai: Dude, what are we going to do this weekend? Nothing's going on.

Rigby: I don't know.

(Sound of the cart coming towards Mordecai and Rigby.)

Mordecai: (gasps) Dude, it's Benson.

(Mordecai and Rigby quickly gulp down the soda, throw the cans away, and clean the cart, as Muscle Man drops off Pops and Benson.)

Muscle Man: (reminding Benson) Alright, so that's tonight. Don't forget it.

Benson: We'll be there.

Muscle Man: See you there.

(Muscle Man drives away in the cart.)

Mordecai: What was that all about?

Rigby: I don't know.

Pops: Oh, Mordecai and Rigby. What costumes are you going to wear?

Mordecai and Rigby: Costumes?

Benson: Muscle Man's throwing a birthday party for Hi Five Ghost. Apparently, it's a costume birthday party.

Rigby: Let me see.

Mordecai: Ah, what? It's invite only.

Benson: You guys got invited, right?

Mordecai: We didn't even know there was a party. Did you know there was a party?

Rigby: No, I did not.

Mordecai: We didn't even know there was a party.

Benson: Oh, well... (snatching the invitation) Maybe you weren't invited.

(Mordecai and Rigby stared at each other. Scene cuts to Muscle Man putting a lot of cans of soda into an ice bucket.)

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man. Uh... we heard that you're having a party tonight. What time should we show up?

Muscle Man: (dumping three cans of soda angrily) NEVER, YOU'RE NOT INVITED!

(Muscle Man then dumps the last few cans of soda into the ice bucket and drives away. Scene cuts to the House.)

Rigby: Ugh! Dude! What's his problem? Why won't he invite us to his party?

Mordecai: Dude. I know why he's not inviting us to the party.

Rigby: Why?

Mordecai: Remember when you were choking this morning.

(Scene cuts to that day's morning, Rigby is choking loudly in the kitchen.)

Muscle Man: (chuckling) Look at Rigby's face.

Mordecai: Oh no, he's choking! (walks over to Rigby) Don't worry, dude. I gotcha.

(Muscle Man continues laughing until Rigby throws up his spit wad, which then gets in his soda and splashes in his face.)

Muscle Man: (disgusted) Aw, sick! Your choke wad spat soda in my face! (whining hysterically)

(Scene cuts back to the present.)

Rigby: Dude, that wasn't our fault, I was gonna die. And besides, we got him a new soda.

(Scene cuts back to the morning as Muscle Man is still whining about the soda on his face.)

Rigby: Ugh, quit whining. Here's another soda, you big baby. (holds the glass of soda, but trips over the soda can, splashing more soda into Muscle Man's face) Uh oh...

(Muscle Man then goes into a ballistic frenzy, pushing the table against the wall, then whamming on it, and lying on the floor still whining. Scene then cuts back to the present again.)

Mordecai: Yep, that's probably why he's not inviting us to his party. We gotta go apologize.

(Scene cuts to M&R walking to Muscle Man's trailer. Rigby then knocks the door.)

Muscle Man: What?

Mordecai: Hey, Muscle Man. We're sorry about that soda thing this morning, so we bought our console as a peace offering. You can borrow it for your party.

Muscle Man: One, I don't know what you're talking about and B, I'm busy. But I'll still take your video game. (swipes the system from Mordecai and Rigby, then closes the trailer door) Yo, H.F.G.! I found a video game system on the ground. Let's see what happens when we put it in the microwave.

Rigby: Dude, you said that was gonna work.

Mordecai: (sighs) I know, I know.

Rigby: He'd better not trash our system. That thing wasn't cheap.

Mordecai: Come on!

(Scene cuts to later when M&R drive the cart and see Muscle Man prepare the decorations for the party.)

Rigby: Ugh! Man, he's not gonna invite us. We already said sorry. What else can we do?

Mordecai: (comes up with an idea) Oh, I know what to do.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: We just have to make Muscle Man think that we don't wanna go to his party.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Reverse psychology. If he thinks we're not into it, then he'll really want us to be there.

Rigby: Ohhhhh...nice.

Mordecai: Just act like the party's lame and watch the invitations come rolling in.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm! (Driving the cart over to Muscle Man as he is in the middle of the decoration preparation.)

Mordecai: Muscle Man, we don't wanna go to your party.

Muscle Man: Good, because I wasn't gonna invite you anyway, so get lost!

Mordecai: Muscle Man, we're sorry about the soda.

Muscle Man: What are you talking about?! I said GET LOST!!!

Mordecai: Ugh, forget it. (hits the gas pedal, spins the cart, and drives away.)

(Scene cuts to the House at nighttime. Mordecai and Rigby are lying on their beds.)

Rigby: (sighs) Wanna play some video games?

Mordecai: We gave away our system, remember?

Rigby: Well, whatever. The party's gonna be lame, anyway. It's just gonna Pops, Skips, and Benson sitting around doin' nothing.

(Mordecai and Rigby sit up as they hear thumping bass music from outside. Looking out the window they see what appears to be a rocking party taking place in a tent in the middle of the park.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoaaaa...

Mordecai: Dude, forget the invitation. Let's just crash it.

Rigby: Yeah.

(The scene cuts to outside the party. A bunch of unidentified guests are in costumes. Mordecai and Rigby show up wearing unconvincing cat and dog masks, respectively/)

Mordecai: Dude, this is amazing.

(They encounter a huge, muscle-bound bouncer, Bobby, at the tent entrance/)

Bobby: Hold up! You're not on the list.

Rigby: What? How do you know we're not on the list?

Bobby: Name?

Mordecai: Mordecai and Rigby.

Bobby: (checks list) Not on the list! I can only let people in that's on the list. (to another guest who walks past) Yo, hold up! You're not on the list.

(Muscle Man appears at the window.)

Muscle Man: Ey, yo, Bobby! You can let that guy in. He seems legit. Wooooo! Let's keep this party goin'!

Bobby: (to Bobby, showing him inside) Right this way, sir.

Mordecai: Aw, what? He didn't even have a costume.

Rigby: Yeah, what the H, Bobby?

Mordecai: Dude, let's go. (Mordecai walks away/)

Rigby: Wait, where you goin'?

Mordecai: We're gonna get into this lame party.

(Mordecai and Rigby appear around the back of the tent house, without their masks on.)

Mordecai: Dude, come on. We'll just go through the window. (Mordecai struggles to open the window. A ghost, looking exactly like Fives except with stubble, appears through the tent wall holding a soda can and wearing shades.)

Lo-Five Ghost: Hoo! Par-tay!

Rigby: Hey, it's fives!

Mordecai and Rigby: Happy birthday, fives!

Lo-Five Ghost: What?

Mordecai: Whoa, sorry. We thought you were someone else.

Lo-Five Ghost: (laughs) Dude, I'm not Hi Five Ghost, I'm his brother, Lo-Five Ghost. What're you guys doing out here? The party's inside! Woo!

Mordecai: Haha, yeah... we... weren't really invited.

Lo-Five Ghost: What? Why not?

Rigby: That's what we wanna know. We don't really care - we just wanna get in.

Lo-Five Ghost: OK, look. I'm not supposed to say this but, if you really wanna get into the party, I can turn you into a ghost.

Mordecai and Rigby: Really?

Lo-Five Ghost: Yeah, then you won't have to go through the door. You can go through the wall. Plus, your costumes will be a lot more believable. So, what do you say? You guys wanna do it?

Mordecai: Let's do it!

Rigby: OK, yeah!

Lo-Five Ghost: Ha ha! Alright! Up high, Down low...

(The two are transformed into ghosts by the power of hi- and lo-fiving.)

Lo-Five Ghost: ...Now you're ghosts.

Mordecai: Aw, man. This is so cool...

Rigby: Dude, dude, punch me in the face!

Mordecai: OK.

(Mordecai swings a punch at Rigby, who squeals in pain.)

Rigby: Nooooouuaaaoow! I thought stuff's supposed to go through us.

Lo-Five Ghost: Well, yeah, real stuff if you want, but not other ghosts. Woooooo! Party!

(We cut to inside. Pops is dressed like an ice cream cone, Benson like a vampire, and Hi Five Ghost is wearing an eyepatch.)

PPP: Mordecai and Rigby, hello!

Mordecai: Hey, happy birthday!

Rigby: Yeah, happy birthday!

Hi Five Ghost: Thanks!

Benson: So, you guys got invited after all?

Rigby: Hmm! Hmm!

Mordecai: Hmm! Hmm! You could say that.

Pops: What wonderful costumes!

Rigby: Ha! These aren't costumes.

Hi Five Ghost: Wait, those aren't costumes?

Mordecai: Yeah, no, we're totally ghosts.

Rigby: Yeah, your brother turned us into ghosts so we could sneak in here and wish you a happy birthday.

Hi Five Ghost: Oh no. This is bad.

Rigby: Yeah, we're bad. We do whatever it takes to party! (Rigby hi-fives Mordecai.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ha ha!

Hi Five Ghost: No, you've got bigger problems. If you don't get turned back into yourselves soon, you'll be stuck as ghosts forever.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Well change us back!

Hi Five Ghost: I can't. I don't know how.

(Cuts to across the room, where Hi Five Ghost angrily confronts his brother at a snack table.)

Hi Five Ghost: Dude! You turned them into ghosts?! Change them back!

Lo-Five Ghost: I don't know how to! But... maybe dad knows.

(Back in the middle of the party, they speak to Hi Five Ghost's Father.)

Hi Five Ghost's Father: Hmm. Not good. Not good at all. If you want to turn back into yourselves, you have to scare someone.

Mordecai: Scare someone?

Hi Five Ghost's Father: Yes. It's the only way.

Mordecai: Dude, let's scare Muscle Man. He doesn't know we're here yet, so he won't be expecting it.

Rigby: OK, let's do it!

(Muscle Man appears at the top of the stairs.)

Muscle Man: Oh, man! I gotta use it!

Mordecai: He's going to the bathroom. Quick, hide!

(They run into the bathroom and turn off the light. Muscle Man opens the door and turns on the light, at which point Mordecai and Rigby scream at him. Muscle Man yells in shock, and grabs his chest, falling to the ground.)

Rigby: What's he doing?

Mordecai: Oh no. He's having a heart attack!

(Mordecai and Rigby drag Muscle Man into the party room.)

Mordecai: We need a doctor!

Hi Five Ghost's Father: Everyone back up, back up! What happened?

Mordecai: We scared him... and he fell over!

Hi Five Ghost's Father: OK, step back, let him breath. (He checks his breath) He's not breathing! (He begins administering CPR) ... he's gone.

(The crowd gasps in horror as Hi Five Ghost's Father closes Muscle Man's eyes for the last time.)

Hi Five Ghost: Oooooooooaaaaugh! You killed my best friend!

Mordecai: We're sorry!

Rigby: Yeah, we didn't mean it!

Mordecai: We just wanted to get into the party.

(On the ground, Muscle Man's eyes open a tiny bit, before he speaks/)

Muscle Man: Got you, dudes. Ha ha ha ha! Best, Prank, Ever! (Muscle Man laughs and whoops.)

Mordecai: What?! What's wrong with you?!

Rigby: This was a prank?!

Muscle Man: (laughs) Yeah, it was! And you two fell for it!

Benson: Wait. I thought you invited us to a costume party.

Muscle Man: I did. But that was just the beginning of my plan.

(A flashback montage begins, narrated by Muscle Man, showing everything he describes.)

Muscle Man: When you jerks spilled soda in my face, I knew I had to get you back. That's when I decided to throw a party. I invited people and I made sure that you were aware of that. Then we bailed Fives' brother out of jail so he could turn you into ghosts.

(The montage ends.)

Muscle Man: It was the ultimate prank. The ultimate payback.

Mordecai: Wait... but if you wanted to prank us at the party, how come you didn't invite us?

Muscle Man: Easy: not inviting you was the only way I knew you'd show. It's called reverse psy-cho-logy, babies! (Muscle Man pronounces the ch- in psychology like the ch- in chew) Ha ha ha ha!

Mordecai and Rigby: Augh!

Rigby: This is the lamest and most expensive prank ever.

Muscle Man: Ha ha ha ha! And it was worth it. Maybe next time you'll think twice before spilling soda in my face.

Mordecai: Yeah, we'll definitely think twice.

Benson: Alright, I'm out of here.

(The guests all start to leave.)

Muscle Man: Ha ha ha ha! Where you guys goin'? Thee's still plenty of food! (Muscle Man begins to stuff his face with food and laughs) Ha ha ha ha!

(Muscle Man begins to choke.)

Rigby: Oh, dude, Muscle Man's choking! (To Hi Five Ghost's Father) You have to help him! You're a doctor!

Hi Five Ghost's Father: No, I'm not a doctor. That was just part of the prank. Does anyone know the Heimlich?

(The remaining guests look to each other helplessly.)

Rigby: Mordecai knows it.

Mordecai: Yeah, right, he's just faking it. As soon as I help him, he's going to be all (mimics Muscle Man's voice) Got you again, dudes. (Switches back to his normal voice) I'm sick of it.

Rigby: Ah, lame. Dude, are you pranking us?

(Muscle Man shakes his head as he continues to choke. He falls to his knees.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Dude, he's not pranking us!

Mordecai: I got you Muscle Man, I got ya!

(Mordecai performs the Heimlich and gets the food out of Muscle Man's throat.)

Mordecai: I hope this makes us even.

Muscle Man: It does. Lo-Fives, change 'em back.

(Lo-Five Ghost clicks his fingers and returns Mordecai and Rigby to their normal selves.)

Muscle Man: I'm sorry I pranked you guys so hard. Look. It's gonna be a real party, and you guys can stay if you want to.

(Muscle Man offers his hand, and Mordecai shakes it.)

Benson: So, seriously. Is this a real party or not?

Muscle Man: Does this answer your question?

(Muscle Man waves a cassette tape, then throws it towards the tape deck, but misses.)

Muscle Man: Aw.

Benson: No. Doesn't really answer my question.

Muscle Man: I thought I could get it in the tape deck. (Walks over to and picks up the tape). Here. Does this answer your question? Everybody, party! (The music starts and the guests all dance.)

Mordecai: Can you believe this?

Rigby: No. Hey, next time you see Muscle Man with a soda, can you remind me not to spill it in his face?

Mordecai: Yes. Yes I can.

(Muscle Man appears with an odd-looking video game system.)

Muscle Man: Hey guys. I thought you'd like to have this back.

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, thanks.

Mordecai: Hey, wait. Is this just paper mache?

Muscle Man: Yeah, sorry guys. I sold the real one to a pawn shop. It was all a part of the prank.

Mordecai: Are you serious?

Rigby: What's wrong with you?

(Muscle Man pulls the real console from behind his back.)

Muscle Man: Got ya, dudes. (The episode ends)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai, do me a solid and get me a lemonade from the kitchen?

Mordecai: Okay, but you owe me a solid.

Rigby: Of course, that's how solids work.

(Mordecai offers Rigby the lemonade. Rigby takes it. A commercial on the television shows a bald, muscular man using a shake-weight)

Mordecai: Uhh! Do me a solid and change the channel?

Rigby: Do me a solid and pass the remote, so I don't have to get so close to the commercial?

(Mordecai hands Rigby the remote. The two are now in the kitchen)

Mordecai: Do me a solid and turn this comic book page?

(Cut to upstairs)

Rigby: Do me a solid and dry my hands?

(Rigby flaps his hands while Mordecai looks disgusted)

(Cut to outside on the porch)

Mordecai: Do me a solid and fluff this cushion?

(Cut to Mordecai and Rigby's room)

Rigby: Sharpen my pencil?

Mordecai: Fold these socks?

(Cut to the kitchen)

Rigby: Cheese these nachos?

(The two laugh goofily and cheese the whole box of nachos)

(Cut to outside.)

Pops: (In the cart) Yoo-hoo! Mordecai, Rigby!

Mordecai & Rigby: Hey, Pops. Hey, Skips.

Skips: Ya think ya want some chips with that cheese?

Rigby: Oh, yeah. I guess we over did it with the cheese, huh?

(Rigby throws the nachos at a tree)

Rigby: Huh!

(Pops, Skips, Mordecai and Rigby laugh goofily)

Pops: Aren't you suppose to be working at the Snack Bar today?

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Rigby: Do us a solid and cover for us?

Skips: You shouldn't abuse the power of the solid. Bad things will happen.

Mordecai: Can you at least pretend you didn't see us?

Skips: Okay. But you owe me a solid.

(Skips and Pops exit the scene)

Rigby: We should probably get out of here.

Mordecai: Do me a solid and buy me a cup of coffee?

(Cuts to the The Coffee Shop )

Rigby: Do me a solid and pull out my seat?

(Mordecai pulls out a chair and Rigby sits in it)

Mordecai: Don't look now dude, but Eileen is totally checking you out. (Eileen is now at the scene, checking at Rigby while she cleans a table) I think she likes you.

Rigby: Shut it!

Mordecai: You should go for it. You'd make a cute couple.

Rigby: STOP TALKING! (Repeatedly punches Mordecai)

Mordecai: Here's your chance. Dude, she's coming this way.

Eileen: Hey guys, here's your order. I triple dipped your sandwich, Rigby, just the way you like it. So, um, Rigby, I was wondering, do you like miniature golf? (Rigby just stares) Me, too! Uh, you know, in an ironic way. My shift ends early tonight. Wanna go?

Mordecai: Yeah Rigby, wanna go?

Rigby: Yeah, I waxing my car tonight, so..

Eileen: Oh, that's cool. I didn't mean it like a date or anything, it would be a group thing; you, me, Mordecai, and Margaret. (Mordecai looks surprised) But it's cool if you're busy, totally cool, totally. I'll get you a refill. (Eileen then walks away, looking depressed, and speaks quietly to herself) Idiot...idiot...

Rigby: Ugh. Why did we have to come on her shift?

Mordecai: Dude, do me a solid and go out with Eileen so I can go on a date with Margaret.

Rigby: What? Why?

Mordecai: Dude, come on. This is my chance to finally get with Margaret.

Rigby: No, I'm not doing it.

Mordecai: What do you want? I'll do your work for a week. You can be player one at any video game.

Rigby: Dude, there's no way I'm going out with Eileen.

Mordecai: Rigby, please! You have to do me this solid.

Rigby: Alright, I'll do it for 10 solids.

Mordecai: (Mordecai hits the table) What? That's ridiculous!

Rigby: Ok, that's cool. Then I guess you don't mind "Morde-crying" yourself to sleep tonight, instead on going on a hot date with Margaret.

Mordecai: Argh! Fine, I owe you 10 solids.

Rigby: Then it's a date.

(Outside of the coffee shop)

Mordecai: I'm telling you dude, I'm gonna make my move tonight with Margaret. I'm gonna make my move!

Rigby: Yeah, making your move to total loser-dom.

Mordecai: Rigby, be cool.

Rigby: Oh, I'll be cool alright, (To himself) but I might have to use a solid or two to get though.

(Margaret and Eileen come out)

Eileen: Hi Rigby, you look nice.

Rigby: (Flatly) Oh, hey Eileen.

Mordecai: I hope everybody's ready for an awesome night. I was thinking that maybe after mini golf, we can grab dinner and then, uh, maybe a late screening of Fat Heat. You guys like that movie?

Margaret: Wow Mordecai, you really figured out tonight's plans.

Rigby: Yeah, he wants to make it last, (Quietly) cause it will never happen again. (Mordecai punches Rigby) Ow!

Margaret: Well, I guess we better get going if we're gonna fit all that in. (All four walk to Margaret's car) It should be unlocked.

(Mordecai stares at Margaret, and sighs lovingly)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai? Can you do me a solid and hang back with Eileen?

Mordecai: Agh! Fine. (We go to the next scene, showing the mini golf area) Hey, Margaret check it out! (Sticks two pencils to his teeth, and talks in a transylvania accent) I want to suck your blood. So red and juicy.

Margaret: (Pretends to defend herself with a putter) Aah! Stay back! I've got a putter, and I'm not afraid to use it.

Eileen: Hey, Rigby, look at me! (She kicks sand over a pile of golf balls) I just laid sea turtle eggs, and now I'm gonna swim out to sea. Although, many of my hatchlings won't live to adulthood.

(The others stare at Eileen)

Rigby: Let's just get this over with. (We now cut to Margaret, ready to putt the ball) Hey, Mordecai. (Rigby gestures Mordecai to come over)

Mordecai: Ugh!

Rigby: Do me a solid, and yell as loud as you can.

Mordecai: What? Why? You don't even get anything out of that.

Rigby: Cool, then we can call off this stupid date and go home.

Mordecai: Okay, okay. I'll do it. (He screams which messes up Margaret's shot)

Mordecai (continued): (Sheepishly) Ha, ha. Ha...hey.

(Cuts to the next scene where the gang are having lunch)

Mordecai: Sorry about ruining your shot earlier, Margaret.

Margaret: (Gulps) Oh, it's no big deal.

Mordecai: Yeah, especially since you beat us all.

Margaret: I've had a lot of practice. My dad used to bring me here when I was little.

Mordecai: Well, in honor of your big win, I made you a trophy. (Shows her a figure made out of fruit, and he makes monster noises)

Margaret: Oh, wow! I'll treasure it for as long as it stays fresh. (Laughs)

Rigby: Hmph.

(Eileen starts throwing spices at Rigby like confetti)

Eileen: Whoo-hoo! Congratulations on second place, Rigby!

Rigby: (Groans and puts hot sauce on his burrito) Mordecai, can you do me a solid and tell me if this burrito tastes fishy?

Mordecai: Ahh. (Grabs the burrito, takes a bite, and notices the spiciness. He accidentally spits it on Margaret. Then he takes a sip of his drink) Aah! Dude, what did you put in that?

Rigby: Hmph!

Mordecai: Oh, wow. Sorry Margaret.

Margaret: (Wipes the food off her and sighs) It's okay. I didn't like this top, anyway.

(Cuts to the movie theater)

Rigby: Psst, can you do me a solid and get some popcorn?

Mordecai: I'm all out of money!

Rigby: (Clicks his tongue while pointing to Margaret) Eeh.

Mordecai: Ugh! Uh, hey Margaret, can I borrow five bucks?

Margaret: (Annoyed) Sure, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Thank you.

(Mordecai gets out of his seat to get popcorn for Rigby while the movie plays)

Bellhop: You have a telephone call at the front desk.

Man: (On the phone) Yes, I understand. (A lady walks up to him) That was the tailor again. (Mordecai passes by Margaret with the popcorn) He says there's nothing else we can do.

(Mordecai gives the popcorn to Rigby and he starts eating)

Lady: (Gasps) Did he try?

Man: He's tried everything!

Rigby: Hey, do me a solid and get some butter up in this.

(Mordecai gets up again to get the butter, then returns)

Mordecai: Here.

Lady: We can't go in yet. The reactor needs to cool down.

Rigby: (While Rigby eats his popcorn, Eileen reaches out to hold Rigby's hand. Rigby then gives Eileen the popcorn) Dude, my hands are all slick from the butter. Do me a solid and get some napkins.

Mordecai: (Pulls out napkins) You mean these napkins? Ohhhhh! (Throws the napkins in Rigby's face) In your face! Someone just wasted their sixth solid!

Rigby: (Wipes his hands off) Hey, do me a solid and take the heat for this.

Mordecai: Take the heat for what? (Rigby takes a deep breath, and blows out a fake fart) Ugh... (Stands up) Sorry. Sorry, everybody.

(Cuts to the house)

Eileen: This is where you live? Wow!

Mordecai: Ha ha, yeah. Make yourselves at home.

(Rigby, Margaret, and Eileen sit down on the couch)

Rigby: Man, I don't know about you guys, but I can go for some dessert. Mordecai?

Mordecai: (Glaring) Yes, Rigby?

Rigby: Can you do me a solid and get us some ice cream sandwiches? Ahh. Make it a double solid, and get the good ones from the Snack Bar.

Mordecai: (Glares again) I'll be right back. (Walks away)

Eileen: Do you have any board games?

(Mordecai later comes back)

Mordecai: Alright, I brought them.

Muscle Man: It's about time.

Mordecai: Why are Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost here?

Muscle Man: Rigby said there were ice cream sandwiches at this party. (Snatches the bag from Mordecai) Hook it up! (Takes one out and shows it to the girls) Hey ladies, you want some of this?

Margaret: (Takes sandwich form Muscle Man) It's getting pretty late. I think I'm gonna go home.

Mordecai: What? No, the night's still young! Can't you hang out a little longer?

Eileen: Yeah, Margaret. We haven't even eaten our ice cream sandwiches yet.

Muscle Man: They're the premium kind.

Margaret: Alright.

Mordecai: Great. Rigby, can I see you in the kitchen for a second?

Rigby: What for? (Mordecai grabs him by the arm) Aah! Ok!

Mordecai: (Sternly) We'll be right back.

Muscle Man: Awkward. (Continues eating his sandwich)

Mordecai: Why are you using your solids to ruin my date with Margaret?

Rigby: Why'd you use your solid to ruin my life?

Mordecai: (Facepalms) Aaagh! Quit being a baby.

Rigby: Watch it. You don't wanna mess with someone who still has one solid left.

Muscle Man: (Off-screen) Hey ladies, watch what else I can do with my ice cream sandwich.

Margaret: (Off-screen) Mordecai, I think I'm gonna go soon.

Mordecai: Fine. Just use your last solid and get it over with. I don't want Margaret to leave.

Rigby: Okay... Can you do me a solid and... (Whispers the solid to Mordecai, and Mordecai seems to be disturbed)

Mordecai: No, no way! I'm not doing that!

(Rumbles can be heard and the ground starts shaking. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

Rigby: (Angrily) You have to, it's a solid!

Mordecai: You're insane! I'm not doing it! (Rumbles can be heard again, but Mordecai just ignores them and walks over to Margaret) Hey Margaret, you wanna check out my record collection before you go?

Margaret: I don't--

Eileen: Yeah, Margaret, you love music. I'll stay down here with Rigby.

Margaret: Okay.

Rigby: Mordecai!

Mordecai: Just ignore him.

(Rumbles can be heard again, again and this time, Muscle Man Margaret and Eileen can hear them.)

Eileen: What was that?

Rigby: You'd better do it!

Mordecai: Lay off, Rigby!

(Margaret and Mordecai begin to go upstairs. A large earthquake occurs, slowly tearing the house apart)

Margaret: What's happening?

Eileen: (Runs to Rigby) Rigby! (A piece of the floor breaks and lifts her up slightly, hitting her in the face)

Rigby: (Points to Mordecai) It's because you didn't do the solid! Do the solid!

Mordecai: No!

(The house rumbles even more; viewed as if trapped in an erupting volcano. Everyone except for Mordecai and Rigby grab any securing place possible)

Rigby: Do it, or we're gonna die!

(Margaret screams)

Mordecai: I don't care. I'm not doing it.

Rigby: You have to!

(Benson, Skips and Pops walk in)

Benson: What are you two doing?!

Skips: I thought I told you not to abuse the solids.

Mordecai: It wasn't me! It was Rigby! He asked me to do one that was worth like 10 solids!

Skips: What was it? (Mordecai whispers the solid to him) Wow, that's crazy.

Rigby: But he's gotta do it! It's a solid!

Skips: Do us a solid and do your solid.

Mordecai: No! No way!

Margaret: Just do it already, Mordecai!

Mordecai: But you'll never respect me again!

Margaret: Not if you're just doing a solid! That's what friends are for! They come through for each other when they need it most!

Mordecai: (Amazed) Wow, I guess I never thought of it that way before.

Eileen: Margaret does solids for me all the time.

Margaret: Yeah! Like tonight, I broke a date so Eileen could go out with Rigby!

Mordecai: Wait, you're only here because you're doing Eileen a solid? (Looks down in shame)

Rigby: Hey, um, we're really gonna die if you don't do me that solid.

(Margaret screams and jumps as the stairs begin to crumble)

Mordecai: Fine, you win. I'll do it. (Stands in front of everyone and crouches down, making weird noises. Pops covers his eyes and Skips shakes his head)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro.

(As everyone watches in disgust, Rigby records it on tape. Scene cuts to him, Pops, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost watching it)

Rigby: Ok, ok. Shh, shh. Get ready, here it -- here it comes in 5, 4, 3, 2...

Mordecai (on the tape): Honk, honk. Errrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!

(All laugh. Mordecai walks downstairs with a displeased look on his face)

Mordecai: You're watching it again?

Rigby: This is a new version I edited together. Dude, come over here! You gotta see the look on your face, it's the best part.

Muscle Man: Ahaha! Classic!

Mordecai: You know what, Rigby? You're a jerk! Have fun with your little tape. I'm going to the arcade. (Begins to walk away)

Rigby: Aw, come on, Mordecai. Don't be like that. I'll come with you.

Mordecai: No way, I'm done hanging out with you! You're not my friend! I'm outta here...

Rigby: Mordecai, wait! I almost forgot. I still owe you that solid.

Mordecai: What solid? What are you talking about?

Rigby: That solid, remember? The one where you told me to destroy the tape.

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: Yeah. I was just about to do it. (Takes out the tape) I hope there's no hard feelings. (Destroys the tape)

Muscle Man: Aw, man! What is wrong with you?!

Rigby: Sorry, guys. A soild's a solid.

Muscle Man: Aw, what? Come on!

Pops: Oh, well. I suppose it's true.

Mordecai: Hey, Rigby.

Rigby: Yeah?

Mordecai: Do me a solid and come to the arcade with me?

Benson: All right, listen up. The cart needs a new suspension system, I don't know why that would be.

(Mordecai and Rigby look around)

Benson (continued): The old cemetery is falling apart and the house is in need of general repairs.

Muscle Man: What's wrong with the house?

(The stair he's sitting on breaks)

Benson: That's what wrong with the house. The problem is, we don't have the money to fix any of it. So does anyone have any ideas for how we can raise the money to cover these costs?

(Rigby raises his hand)

Benson (continued): Yes, Rigby?

Rigby: What's in it for us?

Benson: If you come up with something successful, you'll get a... (Zooms in closer to Benson's mouth for the next three words) ...paid day off.

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Muscle Man: Hey, I got some choice sports equipment in the shed! Let's have a sports tournament, and get physic--

(The stair breaks apart, and he falls through)

Benson: Any other ideas?

Pops: A bake sale!

Benson: No.

Skips: A concert?

Benson: Mmm...

Mordecai: Oh! Hey Benson--

Benson: No.

Rigby: We could--

Benson: No!

Mordecai: Come on, Benson, just hear us out!

Benson: (Moans) Fine. What is it?

Rigby: We could have a scary movie night!

Mordecai: Yeah, in the abandoned cemetery!

Benson: You guys want to see a scary movie there?

Mordecai: Yes.

Benson: You know what? That could actually work. That's not a bad idea!

Muscle Man: Aw, what?

Skips: Yeah. We had a movie night there a long time ago. It was a huge success!

Pops: Ooh! A night of the macabre in the crypt! How exciting!

Benson: Alright, it's settled then. (Gives everyone their jobs) Skips, you'll set up the chairs.

Skips: Hmph.

Benson: Pops, you'll be in charge of concession.

(Pops laughs)

Benson (continued): Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, you'll be in charge of decoration duties.

Muscle Man: Yeah! (High fives Hi Five Ghost)

Benson: I'll be in charge of admissions. Mordecai and Rigby... (Pause) You're in charge of getting the movie and getting the word out. But if this doesn't work, you won't be getting a paid day off.

Mordecai: Pfft, it's gonna work.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Rapping) Because we know everything about scary movies, and you know nothing about scary movies! We'll save the park with our knowledge of scary movies!

Benson: STOP SINGING OR YOU'RE FIRED!

Mordecai and Rigby: Our... knowledge... of... scary... movies.

Mordecai: We'll go get the movie.

(Mordecai and Rigby go to Movie Shack Hut)

Mordecai: You find anything yet?

(Scene goes to inside the Movie Shack Hut)

Rigby: We gotta get this one!

(Screen goes to a videocasette of Mounties of Death: Hoser Spree)

Rigby (continued): Mounties of Death: Hoser Spree!

Mordecai: Eh, the book was better. (Puts back the tape) Oh, this is a classic of Italian horror!

(Screen goes to a VHS of Libraria: Beware the Dewey Dethimal System)

Mordecai (continued): Libraria!

Rigby: Dude, what is with you? Nobody's gonna want to read subtitles!

Movie Shack Hut Employee: Oh, so you guys think you know about horror? Come into my lair.

(Gets a DVD from under the counter)

Movie Shack Hut Employee (continued): This is from my personal stash.

(Mordecai and Rigby look at it and the screen goes up to show the case. Scary music is heard in the background.)

Movie Shack Hut Employee (continued): Zombocalypse 3D!

Rigby: Oh yeah, I saw this a few years back.

Movie Shack Hut Employee: No you didn't.

Rigby: Huh?

Movie Shack Hut Employee: This is the foreign boot-leg director's cut. 3 hours and 28 minutes of remastered pee your pants horror and gore that will make your eyeballs barf!

Mordecai: Wait. (Takes the tape out of the case) What kind of tape is this?

Movie Shack Hut Employee: Duh, Zetamax 3D, it's like the only way to truly experience this movie. Of course you'll need... (He groans as he picks up the projector) one of these babies. The Zetamax Decktron LX. It'll make those zombies really pop.

Mordecai and Rigby: Whooooa..

(The employee smiles)

Mordecai: We'll take it.

Movie Shack Hut Employee: Wise choice. (He picks up  a bunch of dirty 3D glasses) Here, you guys are gonna need some of these babies. (Zooms in on the glasses) I'll go ring you guys up.

Mordecai and Rigby: Paid day-off!

(They high-five and it cuts to a montage)

(The montage shows Mordecai and Rigby going to the cementary to clean up which is covered in garbage, Mordecai and Rigby handing out posters but no one takes them, Skips is seen reading the newspaper, Mordecai and Rigby set up the projector, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are making decorations, Mordecai and Rigby hanging up posters, Benson at the Snack Bar and people show up, Mordecai and Rigby at Horror-Con passing out the posters, a line of people come to get their tickets at the Snack Bar and money is falling around Benson. Montage ends and goes to the cementary, Skips hands out the 3D glasses and Pops is making cotton candy)

Pops: Get your candy cob webs on a stick!

Benson: I can't believe it. They actually did it!

Muscle Man: I STILL think we should've had a sports tournament. If this movie night fails, which I know it will, I've got my sports gear here as a back-up plan.

(Muscle Man drops the equipment on the ground)

Muscle Man: You dudes are gonna thank me for this.

(Muscle Man walks away and Rigby starts the movie, the crowd cheers; the movie begins with the Zombie Slayer walking down a street)

Zombie Slayer: I was your average everyday kinda guy but that was before IT all happened. Before the satellite triggered the deadly necro virus and took everything I ever knew.

(A zombie comes out of a car window)

Zombie Slayer: Batter up!

(He hits the zombie with his bat which makes the zombie hit the screen and the title comes up)

Zombie Slayer: This is Zombocalypse 3D!

(The crowd cheers)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah-yuh! (They hi-five each other)

(The movie shows Zombie Slayer and his girlfriend in a house while the zombies are outside)

Zombie Slayer: Don't worry baby. I got these suckers. Baby?

(His girlfriend turns out to be a zombie)

Zombie Slayer: Oh, great!

(She tackles him and hisses; the crowd gasps)

Rigby: (Shaking) Oh man, oh man, oh man!

Zombie Slayer: Baby, you let yourself go real bad.

(She groans; Mordecai grabs Rigby's shoulder which makes Rigby yell and knock over the projector, causing the film to stop; the crowd boos)

Rigby: Dude, why did you do that?

Mordecai: I didn't know you'd freak out that bad.

Man: Hey I want my money back!

(Others agree and Benson, who's in the crowd, turns around to see Mordecai and Rigby)

Benson: Fix it! Fix It!

Mordecai: Come on, come on!

(They put the projector back on the box, Rigby blows on the tape then spits on it)

Mordecai: Aw, why did you spit on it?

Rigby: Shut up, shut up, shut up!

(Rigby puts it in the projector the wrong way and it doesn't work)

Mordecai: Dude, why isn't it working?

Benson: (Slamming his chair against the ground) Fix it! FIX IT! FIX IT!

(Rigby gets on the projector and shakes it; it causes rays to go out and into the ground while one of which hits a guy)

Man: Ow my kidneys!

(A zombie is seen awakening and Mordecai takes the tape out)

Mordecai: Aw dude, you put it in backwards!

(Mordecai puts it in the projector the right way)

Mordecai: There.

(The movie continues playing, the crowd cheers and Benson goes back to watching the movie)

Mordecai and Rigby: Phew.

Rigby: Hmph, hmph. Thanks for almost getting rid of our paid day-off, you loser.

(A zombie is seen coming out of the ground, rips the screen and walks toward the crowd)

Rigby: Whoa.....The zombies really do pop out at you.

Mordecai: Totally. That one is coming really far off the screen. Wait, we're not wearing our 3D glasses.

(The zombie walks up to a man and grabs his arm)

Man: (Chuckles) Hey guys, check this out.

Rigby: That's a real zombie!

(The zombie is about to bite his arm)

Mordecai: Oh man, oh man, what do we do?!

(Zombie Slayer grabs a round chainsaw blade)

Zombie Slayer: Hey, worm bait!

(He throws it and it decapitates the zombie)

Zombie Slayer: Heads up.

(The crowd cheers)

Mordecai: Muscle Man's sport stuff!

(They run to the pile, Mordecai picks up a discus, throws it, and decapitates the zombie)

Rigby: Dude, nice shot. (The ground shakes) What's happening now?!

Zombie Slayer: Okay, genius, let me put this in terms that you'll understand: (The zombies come out of the ground) The thing you just did, it's woken up the dead - and they're ticked off!

(The zombies walk towards the crowd and their arms are seen reaching towards the crowd)

Mordecai:  Dude, if anyone gets hurt, we won't get our paid day-off. We gotta keep the zombies away from the people.

(Mordecai grabs discus' and Rigby grabs javelins and they yell)

Man: (Reaches out towards the zombie) Oh cool.

(A javelin is thrown into the zombie)

Man: Aw man, zombie just took a hit!

(Various zombies are seen killed by discus')

Man: Whoa, did you see that zombie get a discus to the face?

(The crowd cheers; Rigby fights off the zombies and matches Zombie Slayer's moves in the movie, a zombie grabs Rigby's javelin)

Rigby: Whoa!

(The zombie pushes him which makes Rigby stab another zombie causing its head to be stabbed, Rigby hits 2 zombies and hits the one that pushed him)

Rigby: No!

(A javelin gets thrown into a zombie's back and it is shown that Muscle Man threw it)

Muscle Man: Yo guys! I told you this stuff would come in handy!

(3 zombies are seen walking near Muscle Man, HFG, Rigby, and Mordecai; Skips grabs a long stick laying against a tree)

Skips: Duck!

(Skips screams and runs towards the zombies while Zombie Slayer does the same thing on the screen; Skips stabs the 3 zombies, flips, and crushes their heads; Zombie Slayer is kneeling)

Zombie Slayer: Better fire up the grill 'cause I got me a zombie-kabob!

(The crowd cheers; Goes to Pops who's laughing while zombies go near him)

Pops: Now, now. Don't crowd, there's enough for everybody.

Mordecai: Pops!

(Mordecai throws a discus which decaptates all the zombies; a zombie grabs Pops' shoulder and screams)

Muscle Man: Hey worm hole! Get a tasty lick of this!

(Muscle Man throws a shot put ball and it decapitates it)

Benson: (Reaches out to a zombie) Wow, this is awesome.

(Mordecai screams; decapitates the zombie with a discus and the head bounces off Benson's head and he laughs thinking its 3D; Scene goes to a grave nearby with the name Howard "Hellion" Fightington and a big, muscular arm comes out of the ground)

Mordecai: Dude, I think we got them all.

(Howard walks in front of the screen and looks similar to the big zombie seen in the movie; Howard cracks his neck and growls)

Mordecai: Skips, look out!

(Howard growls and Skips kicks his crotch but it turns to dust)

Skips: Oh no.

(Howard punches Skips, picks him up off the ground, and throws him to where Mordecai and Rigby are; Mordecai and Rigby throw their javelins but Howard catches them and throws them at them; Mordecai and Rigby barely get away and they groan in pain as they fall)

Mordecai: Ugh, he's just too strong.

Rigby: Mordecai! A cart!

(The zombies are blinded by the cart headlights while Zombie Slayer is seen in a car)

Mordecai: Okay you lousy, undead creep-

Zombie Slayer: - You've taken a lot from me but if you think you're gonna deprive me of my-

Mordecai: -paid day-off-

Mordecai and Zombie Slayer: You're sorely mistaken!

(Both of them step on the gas and drive towards the zombies; Mordecai and Rigby nod to each other and leap out of the cart, surprising Howard and the cart explodes when it hits him, causing the screen to burn just as the movie ends; The crowd cheers)

Benson: Ha, yeah!

(Rigby is holding the box with money in it)

Mordecai: Dude, I think we totally did it.

Benson: (Laughs) That was great! It felt like I was in the actual movie! Aw man, you guys totally earned that paid day-off.

Mordecai and Rigby: (Hi-fiving each other) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Benson: And you're gonna earn another one cause we're doing this again tomorrow night, the exact same way.

(He laughs and walks away)

Mordecai: Uh.....do you think we can take that paid day-off tomorrow?

Cop: What did I tell you, Mannetti? The cream always rises... (Takes sunglasses off) ...to the cop! (Laughs as we zoom out to Mordecai and Rigby watching the movie)

Mordecai: Boooo. Who writes this stuff? (Eats some chips and passes them to Rigby)

TV Announcer: Tonight, and tonight only, at the City Arena Center, it's Double R-W's Wrassle Frassle VII live! Come watch all your favorites battle it out for the championship belt! It's Really Real Wrestling at its best! Tonight at 8! For tickets, call your momma and cry about it, 'cause this event is sold out!

Mordecai: Augh! I can't believe we didn't get tickets.

Rigby: Dude, I told you we should've left early to stand in line, but no, you wanted to finish your work.

Mordecai: Dude, Benson would have snapped his crank if we just left work. You gotta be responsible sometimes.

Rigby: (Flatly) And that's why we don't have tickets for wrestling, because all you can think about is Benson's crank.

Mordecai: (Gets up) Oh. You're asking for it, man.

Rigby: You're asking for it, man.

Mordecai: You trying to get me mad? You know what happens when I get mad.

Rigby: Oh, I know.

(Pause. Mordecai and Rigby run off, and suddenly, they're wearing wrestling clothes as they mock dramatic entrances and growl.)

Mordecai: Listen up, Mysterious Mr. R, Mad Man Mordo's gonna take you down. (Rapping) And I'm not talkin' downtown, I'm talkin' six feet underground! (Rips shirt)

Rigby: Mad Man Mordo? More like Bland Man Bored-o. When I'm through with you, people will be all like, "Ah, what happened to his face?", and I'll be like, "Mysterious Mr. R is what happened to his face."

Mordecai: That's it!

(Mordecai and Rigby begin fighting, and start mocking slow-motion strikes. Then, Mordecai knocks Rigby to the ground and pins him there before Rigby gets up to pick up a nearby chair, and then hit Mordecai's back with it. Rigby starts running around in circles as Pops comes into the room. He runs up to Mordecai and pins him to the ground.)

Rigby: Dude, Pops, chill! Let him go!

Pops: Oop! (Laughs) Oh, I just love to wrestle! (Lets go of Mordecai, and gets off of him. Mordecai was unconscious for a bit, but was waken by Rigby.)

Mordecai: (Gets up and groans) That wasn't wrestling! You were actually hurting me! (Starts rubbing the back of his head and left arm)

Rigby: Yeah, Pops, what's your problem? Wrestling's totally fake. You weren't doing it right.

Pops: Uh, fake? No. no, no, I assure you, it's real. I used to wrestle back in my schooling days. (Pulls out wallet and takes out picture) Look, here I am. (Shows black-and-white picture of a young Pops in a helmet and singlet) We learned how to wrestle just like the Greckos and the Romans!

Mordecai: Whoa, cool!

Pops: (Reaches further into wallet) Oh, I'm so glad you think so! Because I thought you two might want to accompany me to... (Pulls out three tickets) ...this. (Shows that they are WFVII tickets)

Mordecai and Rigby: (Gasp) Double R-W Wrassle Frassle VII? You got tickets?

Rigby: Pops, you're a legend! (Pumps arms) Really Real Wrestling!

Mordecai and Rigby: Really Real Wrestling!

Mordecai, Rigby and Pops: (Pops' timing is slightly off) Really Real Wrestling! Really Real Wrestling!

Mordecai: Aw, you gotta teach us some of your moves, Pops. (Rigby pushes table away)

Pops: Okay, I will go easy on you boys this time. (M&P face eachother)

Rigby: And, go! (Pops lunges towards Mordecai and pins him down)

Mordecai: Impressive, Pops, but you forgot about this. (To Rigby) Rigby! (M&R high-five eachother. Then, Rigby screams before jumping onto Pops, cracking his back)

Mordecai and Rigby: WHOAAAAA!

Pops: My back... (Right then, Benson comes into the room)

Benson: Hey, do you guys-- (Gasps, then runs to Pops) Pops! What happened, are you okay?

Pops: Yes, yes, all is fine. Just not as limber as I used to be.

Benson: (To M&R) What did I tell you about wrestling?

Mordecai: Sorry, we didn't mean to.

Rigby: Yeah, come on, Pops! Shake it off, you gotta take us to Wrassle Frassle!

Benson: What? No, you guys aren't going anywhere. Pops can't even get up. He needs to take it easy.

Pops: No, no. I can get up. (Tries to get up, but falls flat on his chest again)

Mordecai: But Pops already got us tickets!

Rigby: It's the biggest wrestling event of the year!

Benson: I don't care.

Pops: Wait, Benson, surely we can all still go. (Falls again)

Benson: I'm sorry, Pops. It's not gonna happen. You have to stay home for your own good.

Pops: Oh, boo.

Benson: (To M&R) Now, help Pops upstairs, and don't even think of leaving him alone. 'Cause if you leave, don't bother coming back.

Mordecai: Fine. We get it.

Benson: Does that one get it? 'Cause sometimes, I wonder.

Rigby: I get it, I get it. Watch out for Pops and don't go to wrestling. (Sighing) Yeah.

Benson: Good.

(Clock transition to nighttime. M&R are tucking Pops into bed)

Pops: Why are we going to bed so early?

Mordecai: It's the easiest way to make sure you don't get hurt again.

Rigby: Yeah, sleep is the best medicine.

Mordecai: I thought laughter was the best medicine.

Rigby: Not when you're telling the jokes.

Mordecai: Pfft, whatever. You wanna hear a joke, Pops?

Pops: I better get some rest. (Mordecai sighs and turns off the light. M&R go into their sleeping bags under Pops' bed)

Mordecai and Rigby: Good night, Pops.

Pops: Sleep speed to all.

(The clock fades from 7:32 to 8:13. Rigby is snoring before he suddenly opens his eyes and looks up to the bed)

Rigby: (Whi​spering) Mordecai, come on. (Shakes him awake)

Mordecai: Hm? What?

Rigby: Come on, let's sneak out and go to Wrassle Frassle.

Mordecai: What? (Looks at the bed) What about Pops?

Rigby: He needs his rest anyways. He'll be fine.

Mordecai: You sure he's asleep?

Rigby: Yeah, look. (Whispering as Mordecai and Rigby turn to Pops) Pops. Pops.

(M&R turn to each other and nod, and proceed to exit the bedroom. Mordecai looks onto the bed to a few seconds before leaving the room. We pan over to see that the pink shape was not Pops' head, but a big pink teddy bear. Outside, Pops grunts as he crawls his way to the garage and opens the door slightly before he enters and knocks down the door with his taxi and flies off. We then cut to the City Arena Center. A fat wrestler pins two-headed wrestler's heads between his arms. The wrestler escapes and weakly punches the other wrestler before he throws them into the ropes. On top, M&R find their seats.)

Rigby: Row Z, seats 97, 98 and 99! (They sit down)

Mordecai: Man, we made it! This is awesome! (Watches on big-screen view) So close to the action! (The two-headed wrestler runs to the ropes and rams into the fat wrestler, knocking himself to the ground. The fat wrestler then pins him to the ground as the referee comes in.)

Referee: One, two, three! (The crowd cheers)

Mordecai and Rigby: OHHHHH!

Rigby: See man, we couldn't have missed this! Totally worth sneaking out!

Mordecai: Totally. Still though, (Turns to the empty seat beside him) it's pretty lame Pops couldn't be here.

Rigby: Don't worry, man. We did the right thing. Pops is totally safe back home in his bed.

(Cut to the inside of Pops' car. Pops laughs as he approaches the arena. Down outside the arena, two guys are wondering where the new wrestler is.)

Manager 1: Hey, bro! Ladder Match is about to start! Where's that new wrestler, Huge Head?

Manager 2: Eh, I don't know. He hasn't shown up yet.

(Right then, Huge Head's limo drives up. Huge Head steps out. He looks like a younger Pops. He checks his watch and quickly runs to the arena before Pops' headlights shine on him. He gasps before the car crashes on him)

Manager 1: Well, did you call him?

Manager 2: Yeah, I called him. What, do you think I'm a moron?

Manager 1: Hey, who's this?

Pops: (Limping out of car) Hello!

Manager 2: Yeah, this is him, right?

Manager 1: He's gotta be. Look at the size of that thing! (To Pops) Hey, Huge Head, you're late!

Pops: Oh, I'm sorry. Would you mind helping me inside?

Manager 1: What?

Manager 2: His dramatic enterance!

Manager 1: Oh yeah, sure.

(Cut to inside the arena)

Referee: Okay, get ready folks, because it's time for the main event! The Ladder Match! (A manager sets up the ladder as a belt is lowered from a wire below)

Mordecai and Rigby: Aw, yeah! Yeah!

Referee: Who's gonna be the one to reach the championship belt at the top of the ladder? Will it be... (Shown as said:) The Fire Marshall? (Breathes fire) Hissy Fit?(Hisses) The leading champion, Four-Armageddon?

Four-Armageddon: Yeah, yeah! Come on!

Referee: Or, making his Double R-W Wrassle Frassle debut, give it up for... Huge Head! (Fire machines blaze as the managers, carrying Pops, come into the arena.)

Rigby: Ha ha, look at that guy's head!

Mordecai: That guy's head is almost as big as Pops'!

Rigby: It is as big as Pops'!

Mordecai: (Gasps) Dude, that is Pops! (Watches on big-screen view)

Rigby: What? How did he—what?

Mordecai: Dude, he's gonna be pummelled! Come on! (Mordecai and Rigby run down the stairs to Pops) Pops, what are you doing here?!

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, I thought you two were back at home sleeping! Looks like we both couldn't stay away!

Mordecai: Pops, we gotta get you out of here.

Pops: But I just got here! And look, I got here late, and they upgraded my seat!

Rigby: No, Pops, they think you're a wrestler!

Pops: But I am a wrestler. Besides, you said all this was fake. (Four-Armageddon watches from above)

Four-Armageddon: Fake? Who said this was fake?

Pops: (Pointing to Mordecai and Rigby) They did. (Four-Armageddon jumps over the ropes to Mordecai)

Four-Armageddon: Is this fake? (Slaps Mordecai, sending him into the bars. He then goes to Rigby)

Mordecai: Uh, n-no.

Four-Armageddon: How about you, little dude? This seem fake to you? (Double-kicks Rigby into the bars)

Rigby: Aah! No.

Four-Armageddon: Why do you think it's called really real wrestling? 'Cause it's real!

Mordecai: Okay, we were wrong. We're sorry.

Rigby: Yeah, just let us take our friend and go.

Four-Armageddon: "Sorry" doesn't cut it. There are only two ways you guys are getting out of here. In a bodybag, or by beating all of us in the Ladder Match. (Points to ladder, then grabs a microphone in the ring) Listen up! Huge Head and his friends here think all this is fake. (The audience boos) What do you say, we teach him how real this really is? (The audience cheers, then, the bell rings. 4-AG, The Fire Marshall and Hissy Fit get the audience going.) Come on! (To M&R) You better get in the ring, or we're coming out there after ya!

Mordecai: Okay, Rigby and I are goin' after the belt. You stay here, Pops.

Pops: But I can help.

Mordecai: No! Stay here! (Mordecai and Rigby enter the ring) Dude, I'll distract him. You get to the ladder.

(The three wrestlers laugh as Mordecai approaches The Fire Marshall. The Fire Marshall picks up Mordecai and throws him to the ground, following up with a pile driver. Rigby approaches Hissy Fit, but Hissy Fit picks him up and pounds him against his knee as Pops watches in horror. Mordecai tries to climb up the ladder before he is pulled off by The Fire Marshall, then, Rigby attempts to climb before he is pulled off by Four-Armageddon, then thrown to the ground, where Hissy Fit body-slams him. Pops decides to enter the ring, but, when he gets up, he cracks his spine and lands to the ground. He then starts to crawl up the steps. Four-Armageddon punches Mordecai in the stomach as he is held by The Fire Marshall. Just as Rigby is thrown by Hissy Fit, Pops crawls his way in and approaches the ladder, then climbs up. Four-Armageddon is still punching Mordecai as Rigby comes over and elbows him, making him twist Rigby with his legs. He then notices Pops on top of the ladder.)

Four-Armageddon: Hey! (Goes over and pile-drives the ladder, sending Pops to the ground)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops! (Four-Armageddon watches as Pops stands up and cracks his pelvis into place)

Pops: Who wants to wrestle?

(Pops goes over to grab Four-Armageddon by the leg and pins him down, surprising Mordecai. Then, he throws Hissy Fit over his head and to the ground. Rigby then growls as the Fire Marshall breathes fire at him. Pops takes Rigby to duck for cover before he goes over to Four-Armageddon to throw him over his head and squeezes Four-Armageddon's head with his legs before Mordecai and Rigby come and pull his arms to send him to the ground)

Rigby: Real enough for ya? (Pops puts the ladder back in place and climbs up to the belt as he is cheered on. He then finally grabs the belt off the wire)

Referee: And the winner, Huge Head!

(M&R climb up the ladder to Pops as we zoom out to the the big screen view, with the audience still cheering him. Cut to the park, later. Pops' taxi, carrying a police line ribbon, flies down and stops in front of the stairs. Mordecai, Rigby and Pops sneak up the steps to the door. Mordecai reaches for the doorknob, but gets suprised to see Benson on the other side.)

Benson: I knew it. I had a sick feeling, so I came to check on you, and I KNEW it!

Mordecai: Wait, listen, Benso-

Benson: No! You guys are fired! That's it!

Rigby: Wait, what? Come on!

Benson: No! I told you guys but you didn't wanna listen!

Mordecai: Come on, Pops. You gotta help us.

Pops: I cannot tell a lie. Benson, it was all my fault.

Benson: What?

Pops: I snuck out to the wrestling match on my own, and Mordecai and Rigby had to come and get me. I'm sorry.

Mordecai: Yeah. Most of that is technically true, somewhat, so...

Rigby: Plus look, Pops' back is all better.

Pops: It's true!

Benson: This is your last warning. (Leaves and slams door behind him)

Mordecai: Wow. Thanks for taking the blame, Pops.

Pops: (Yawns) I'm just glad it's over.

Mordecai: Yeah. Time for bed, Huge Head.

Rigby: Yeah, Huge Head.

(The real Huge Head looks on from a bush. He's covered in tire tracks and bruises.)

Huge Head: So you think you can steal my name, huh? Well, let's see how you like it if I steal yours... (Puts on hat) ...Pops!

Doctor: [shuts Rigby's eyes and pulls sheet over him] I'm sorry. There was nothing we could do.

(Mordecai, Pops and Benson bow their heads. Mordecai looks at Skips.)

Mordecai: (spitefully) You couldn't let it go. Well, I hope you got what you wanted.

(They all leave, while Skips looks after Rigby. Flashback begins at McHooligan's.)

Benson: Hey. Let me tell you guys something. This guy, this guy right here is so strong. He could take any one of you out in arm wrestling.

Skips: Nah nah. (laughs modestly)

Benson: Skips, Skips. I am your boss, and as your boss, I order you to arm wrestle me.

(Everyone chants 'Skips')

Skips: Alright, alright, if you insist. (slams Benson's arm)

Everyone: OHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

Benson: What did I tell you, what did I tell you?

Pops: Oh, oh, me, me!

(Skips slams Pops' arm. Pops giggles)

Mordecai: Set 'em up Skips, you can't take none of this. Yeah, yeah yeah yeah!

(Skips slams Mordecai's arm)

Mordecai: OHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

(Everyone chants as Skips slams Hi Five Ghost. Skips slams Muscle Man. Everyone chants 'Skips')

Rigby: Now me.

(Everyone laughs)

Rigby: C'mon Skips, set 'em up.

Skips: Okay, I'll go easy on you. (clasps Rigby's hand)

Benson: This is gonna be hilarious. Okay, ready, go!

(Rigby slams Skips)

Rigby: Haters gonna hate!

(Everyone laughs)

Skips: Enough! We're going again, I wasn't ready.

Rigby: Maybe. Or maybe you're just getting weak in your old age, gramps.

(Skips and Rigby clasp hands)

Benson: Okay, ready, go!

(Everyone chants 'go'. Rigby slams Skips)

Rigby: Yeah, yeah yeah! Who's the strongest now? Two in a row!

(Everyone cheers and leaves. Skips stays behind)

Mordecai: That was awesome, man.

Rigby: It's all in the wrist. And also it's in the muscles.

(Cut to Skips sitting on the front steps. Pops sits next to him)

Pops: Hi, Skips. You sure did a bang up job at arm wrestling yesterday. You were beating everyone.

Skips: I didn't beat Rigby.

Pops: Yes, he's quite the arm wrestler, isn't he?

Skips: I'm not the strongest anymore.

Pops: Balderdash! You are the strongest person I know. You were just having a bad day. You should go up to Rigby and demand a rematch. Then you'll see who the strongest is. [giggles and walks away]

Skips: Thanks, Pops.

[Cut to Mordecai and Rigby inside playing Guitar Dudes Reunion Tour.]

Mordecai: Here comes the power move! [presses a button on guitar]

[Character on screen starts shredding his guitar]

Mordecai: [laughs] Dude, this is just like playing real guitar!

Rigby: Check this out! [plays guitar behind his head]

[Buzzing sound plays]

Rigby: No!

[Character on screen starts being pelted with bottles]

Mordecai: Dude, dodge the bottles! Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right!

[Skips blocks the television.]

Mordecai: Aww, what?

Rigby: Come on!

Skips: Rigby! Me, you, rematch.

Rigby: No.

Skips: I said I want a rematch!

Rigby: I'm busy.

[Skips rages and breaks the console in half then exits.]

Mordecai: Dude, not cool.

Rigby: Eh. He'll get over it.

[Cut to Skips working out in his room. Benson knocks.]

Skips: Come in.

[Enter Mordecai, Rigby and Benson]

Benson: Skips? Skips did you break their video game?

Rigby: Yes, yes he did! I already told you!

Benson: I want to hear it from him.

Rigby: Grrrr!

Skips: Yeah.

Benson: What? Wow, uh, I'm sorry Skips, but, you're gonna have to pay for it.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm.

Skips: Oh I'll pay for it. After Rigby gives me a rematch.

Benson: What? That's what this is about?

Skips: You wouldn't understand.

Benson: [scoffs] Yeah, I guess I wouldn't understand.

Rigby: I understand. You just want to lose again. Let's go.

[Skips sets down a chest and puts his arm on it.]

Skips: Set 'em up.

[Rigby clasps his hand with Skips'.]

Benson: Ready? Go.

[Rigby slams Skips' arm. Skips makes a noise of surprise.]

Benson: Make sure you pay him by the end of the week.

Skips: Yeah, I will.

Rigby: What was that? I couldn't understand you. I don't speak second place. Make sure you pay me by the end of the week.

[Mordecai, Rigby, and Benson leave. Skips smashes the chest. Cut to night time, everyone about to leave for 'McHooligan's']

Muscle Man: Aww, yeah! McHooligan's, round two! [slides down banister]

Hi Five Ghost: [goes with Muscle Man] Shotgun!

Benson: [walks down stairs] I hope you guys got your drink tickets 'cause the drinks are on me! Up to a dollar fifty value!

Pops: [walks down stairs] Splendid, I can't wait to get an aguarita!

Rigby: [walks down stairs] I'm gonna get me an ice on the rocks, woo!

Mordecai: Aww, man, my drink ticket!

Benson: Hey, Mordecai, let's hustle!

Mordecai: I'll be back in a sec, guys.

[Cut to Mordecai and Rigby's room, Skips is going through Rigby's drawer.]

Mordecai: Aww, what, Skips? What are you doing?

Skips: Uh, nothing. Uh, going through Rigby's stuff. Rigby, the strongest. There's gotta be a trick.

Mordecai: Dude, Skips, I can't stand to see you like this. Listen. Don't tell him I told you this, but Rigby's been pranking you.

Skips: What!?

Mordecai: [picks up drink ticket] Two words: "Playco Arm boy". [exits] Look it up.

[Cut to Skips using the computer. He watches the Playco Arm boy commercial. A father and his son are arm wrestling]

Father: So, you think you can take on your old man? [slams son and laughs] Easy!

[Son frowns, Playco Arm boy appears and son smiles]

Announcer: How to use Playco Arm boy! First, put on Playco Arm boy, Second, conceal Playco Arm boy, Third, sign our legal Playco Arm boy waver!

[Father and son are arm wrestling again]

Father: Ready for round two, eh?

[SMASH!]

Father: [yelps] Aww! That really hurt, son...

Other Announcer: A subsidiary of Yoshimoto Cybernetics!

[Commercial ends, Skips becomes furious. Montage of Skips training himself and leaving his room. Cut to McHooligan's]

Benson: Hey, Mordecai, what ever happened to Skips?

Mordecai: Uh. He had stuff. To do.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm! Probably resting his old man bones.

[Door slams, Skips appears]

Rigby: OHHHHH! Look who's back for thirds!

[Skips sits down next to Mordecai]

Benson: Don't do it, Skips.

[Skips props his arm up]

Rigby: [props arm up] Say goodnight, gramps.

(Things then run in slow-motion Skips pulls out Rigby's Playco Armboy and arm wrestles again. He then grabs Rigby's arm, lifts him and smashes him down the table. The flashback then ends.)

Skips: I'm sorry, Rigby. I'll make it up to you.

Death: [laughs] Well, well, well. If it ain't old Skips.

[Portal appears and Death rides through on his motorcycle and gets off]

Skips: Death.

Death: [laughs] You haven't changed a bit. So, what's the occasion here, Skips? Is that your buddy there? Finally killed someone, eh?

Skips: I want him back. Let's arm wrestle for him. If I win, I keep him. If you win, you can take me instead.

Death: Aww, big old Skips finally coming in for some old fashion arm wrestling, eh? 'bout time. You've been dodging me for years. Now I get to beat you and take your immortal soul?

[Skips nods]

Death: Deal.

[Death and Skips shake hands. A table appears]

Death: I've been waiting for this day. [takes off jacket to reveal an arm as muscular as Skips' and kisses it] Set 'em up.

Skips: Hmm.

[Death and Skips clasp hands. A referee appears]

Referee: Ready? Go!

[Death and Skips arm wrestle. Sparks appear from their combined fist and the table rises in the air. A whirlpool appears in the ground]

Death: [laughs] Your soul is mine! [laughs and almost slams Skips' arm] Any last words, Skips?

Skips: Two words! Playco Armboy!

Death: Huh?

[Bright white beam emerges. Skips slams Death's arm. The room clears]

Death: No! How is this possible?

Skips: Death, I won. Bring Rigby back, and take a hike!

Death: Skips! Mark my words. [get in motorbike] Someday, I will have your immortal soul. [makes a portal in the wall and spits Rigby's soul into Rigby's mouth]

[Rigby coughs and wakes up. Death rides his motorcycle into the portal]

Skips: Listen, Rigby, sorry for, you know, killing you back there. It was unprofessional.

Rigby: Huh? [turns and sees stitches in back] You know what? Water under the bridge. So you ended up cheating death, huh?

Skips: I learned from the best. [lifts up Playco Armboy]

Rigby: Ohhhh!

[Skips and Rigby laugh]

Skips: Seriously though, you shouldn't cheat. I only did it to save your life.

[Cut to Rigby and Skips walking in the hospital hallway]

Rigby: So, everybody thinks I'm dead?

Skips: Yep.

Rigby: Dude! We gotta prank 'em!

Skips: Uh, you know Rigby, I think I've had enough pranks for today.

Muscle Man: Yeah! Drum solo! (Muscle Man shakes the two cans of soda)

Everyone: Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

Muscle Man: Thanks for sharing the sodas.

Mordecai: Yeah, man. Thanks for sharing the tunes.

The Night Owl: (Speaking over the radio) Who's coming at ya? It's The Night Owl.

Muscle Man: Shut your faces! It's the Night Owl!

The Night Owl: Do you like cars? Do you love cars? If a car was a girl, would you take her on a date and try to get to second base? Well, who's giving away a brand new vintage muscle car? W.H.O.Z, (Muscle man turns up the volume) that's who. All you have to be the last one standing on the catwalk up the W.H.O.Z. Billboard downtown. But you gotta be in it to win it, so come on down tomorrow at noon for your chance to win.

Mordecai: A vintage muscle car?

Rigby: Just for standing?

Muscle Man: Frickin' Sweet!

Mordecai: Maybe it's just the sodas talking, but I think we should work together to win that car.

Muscle Man: I don't know. We really never worked together before.

Mordecai: Well, maybe it's time we cracked open an ice cold can of teamwork. FOR THE CAR!

Rigby: Yeah, we should!

Muscle Man: Let's do it, Babies!

Everyone: YEAH!

(Scene circle-wipes to the W.H.O.Z. billboard)

The Night Owl: Hey, there, radio listeners, this is The Night Owl, comin' to ya live from The Night Owl's first annual Stand-Off for the Steel. We certainly have some ambitious people out here, but only time will tell who has the drive for the ride.

Muscle Man: Aw, man! I can't wait to shove a key into that!

Rigby: Dude, were gonna look so cool all up in there!

Mordecai: Yeah, we will.

(Muscle Man notices someone looking.)

Muscle Man: Is there something on my face?

The Person: Uhh... no?

Muscle Man: THEN QUIT STARING BRO!!!

Mordecai: Save it for the contest, Muscle Man.

The Night Owl: Alright, everybody. I hope you're all comfortable up there, because the Stand off For the Steel starts in 3, 2, 1. WOO..WOO..WOO!

(The crowd begins cheering)

Mordecai: Bring it in guys. Bring it in. (Mordecai, Rigby, High-Fives & Muscle Man get in a crowd) We're not leaving here today without that car, so you know we have to do.

Rigby: Yeah, send those other losers home on their cruddy car!

(The four of them use many tactics to get rid of the other contestants 1.) Knocking their coffee 2.) shooting spitballs 3.) fanning the sweat off from Muscle Man to the other three contestants 4.) Then lastly, a plan to scare the last person off by Rigby showing up to the contestant and saying that Muscle Man is "stabbing" Mordecai and his "ghost" which was High-Fives flowing away.)

The Night Owl: We're down now with the final four, but don't you worry who'd heads, cause there's still plenty of contests left.

W.H.O.Z. Worker: Hey, man, the take guy heard those final four talking and they're gonna share the car. It's over.

The Night Owl: What? The contest can't be over, my ratings were just starting to get good... Bring in the isolation booth.

(The booth gets up at the top of the billboard.)

The Night Owl: How does it feel to be a part of the final four?

Rigby: It feels GREAT!

Mordecai: Awesome.

High-Five Ghost: It's exciting!

Muscle Man: WHOO!!!

The Night Owl: Hm-hmm, and how did you make it this far?

Muscle Man: Working together, baby!

The Night Owl: (laughs) Fantastic. So, what are you gonna do with the car?

Rigby: Share it.

The Night Owl: Hmm, that's funny, because that's not what Mordecai said.

Muscle Man: What did Mordecai say?

The Night Owl: Well, that he was gonna take the car for himself.

Hi Five Ghost: Rigby said that?

The Night Owl: Yeah, that's what Muscle Man said.

Mordecai: I knew it!

Rigby: That jerk!

Hi Five Ghost: I can't believe this!

Muscle Man: Oh, he's gonna pay!

The Night Owl: (laughs) Well, let me tell you, if you really want that car, then you better make sure you're the last one off the W.H.O.Z. Billboard, 'cause there can only be one winner.

(cut to the W.H,O.Z. Billboard, Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost into the tent)

Mordecai: Well, we did it.

Muscle Man: Yep.

Rigby: Yeah.

Muscle Man: Guess all that's left to do now is step down and get the car.

Rigby: That sounds about right.

Muscle Man: Well, I'll meet you guys down there, I gotta take down the tent first.

Mordecai: No, no. We'll take care of the tent. You should go first.

Muscle Man: I'm not stepping off this thing until you three step off it first.

Mordecai: What's that supposed to mean?

Muscle Man: It means I know what you're up to!

Mordecai: (angrily) You know what I'M up to? I know what YOU'RE up to! Step one, working with you was a huge mistake, and step two, get off this billboard. You smell like barf!

Muscle Man: YOU SMELL LIKE BARF!

(Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and High Five Ghost start to beat each other up.)

(Cut scene while another one shows liquid niotrogen going into their tent)

The Night Owl: And now a little insurance to make sure this little competition doesn't end too early... (evil laugh)

(Scene showing Mordecai, Rigby, High-Fives & Muscle Man frozen & now showing the W.H.O.Z. Billboard as the days went on, and the years went by.)

Year 4224...

(Scene showing an a museum of The Night Owl & now showing a can running out liquid nitogen & now showing a scene to Mordecai, Rigby, High-Fives & Muscle Man in the melting ice.)

Mordecai: (Not frozen anymore) You smell like BARF!

(Punches Muscle Man & he's awake)

Muscle Man: Huh?

Rigby: (Gasps)

High-Five Ghost: (Gasps)

(Mordecai, Rigby, High-Fives & Muscle Man were looking around in silence)

Rigby: (Angrily) GET OFF OF THE BILLBOARD, BARFSACK!

Muscle Man: (Angrily) DON'T CALL ME A BARFSACK!

(Rigby, Muscle Man & High-Fives start fighting again)

Mordecai: STOP! STOP! Somethings not right! (Mordecai opens the tent & all of them are shocked) OH MY-..

(Scene showing them & the billboard in a glass and showing everywhere around the museum.)

Rigby: How long have we been up here?

Mordecai: Dude, I think we're in the future.

Muscle Man: Aww, this is all YOUR fault!

Mordecai: ME?! You were the one who was tryin' to get the car for yourself! Yeah, that's right, The Night Owl told me what you said!

Muscle Man: What did I say?

Mordecai: (Points at Muscle Man) That you were gonna trick us so you could get the car for yourself!

Muscle Man: Get your hand outta my FACE! (Slaps Mordecai's hand) I never said that! That's what Rigby said!

Rigby: What?!

Muscle Man: That's what The Night Owl told ME!

Rigby: But The Night Owl told me that's what High-Five Ghost said!

High-Five Ghost: I never said that.

Mordecai: Wait a minute, guys. I think The Night Owl tricked us.

Muscle Man: Yeah, I think you're right, bro!

Security Guard: Hey! Hey you! What are you doing up in the exhibit? (Gasps) You're the contestants! (Presses an emergency button & talks on walkie-talkie) Contestants are unfrozen! I repeat unfrozen! Requesting backup imediently!

(Conversation ends & more liquid nitrogen is coming)

Mordecai: That's not good! We gotta get outta here! Muscle Man, can you start that car?

Muscle Man: Yeah. Let's blow this popsicle stand!

Mordecai: GO! GO! GO!

(Mordecai, Rigby & High-Fives get down from the ladders)

Muscle Man: Get to the car! Fives and I could hot wire it!

(Muscle Man slides down the stairs)

Muscle Man: WHOO! WHOO!..

(Slides on the car but falls but then gets up & goes into the car)

Security Guard: Stop! Stay where you are!

(Transports close to the car door)

Security Guard: Get out of the car!

(Bangs on the car door)

Mordecai: Let's go! Let's go!

(Muscle Man hot wires the car. The security guard breaks the car window)

Mordecai: GO! GO!

(Muscle Man drives the car & crashes to the glass)

Security Guard: (Speaking to walkie-talkie) We've got a problem.

(Scene goes to The Night Owl's front desk)

Security Guard: Contestants fleeing premises, officers in pursuit.

The Night Owl: Don't let them escape.

(Cut scene showing Muscle Man driving the car & Rigby & High-Fives looking behind them)

Security Guard: Stop runners! Return to you're display by once by the order of The Night Owl!

Muscle Man: Night Owl?

Mordecai: He must've built this museum around the contest.

(Scene of still getting away from the guards)

Benson: I always knew those guys were special.

(Guards zapping them with lasers even the car's mirror)

Muscle Man: We gotta find the time machine!

Mordecai & Rigby: WHAT?

Muscle Man: We're in the future bros! There's gotta be a time machine!

Mordecai: I don't think-

~ ATTENTION, museum patrients, the Time Machine Exhibit will be closing in 5 minutes.~

Muscle Man: WHOOOO!! Eat on that, WRONG-ECAI!!

Rigby: Muscle Man, get closer to that Info Booth!

(Rigby Hangs onto High-Five's arm while getting a map from the Info Booth)

Mordecai: How are we gonna find the Time Pavilion?

~ Time Pavilion calculating directions ~

Rigby: It's still loading!

(The security is still firing lasers.)

Muscle Man: Take the wheel!

(Muscle Man gets on top of the car & Mordecai is now driving. They are giving out lasers while Muscle Man took off his shirt and moving it)

Muscle Man: Uggh!

(One laser hit Muscle Man's shirt & turned it into a white figure and he throws it to one of the securities & the other two came on top of the car & Muscle Man was getting one off & High-Fives got the other one off & both of them got back inside the car.)

~ Download complete. Time machine pavilion in 0.7 miles. Turn right. ~

(Mordecai steers to his right)

Rigby: There it is!

(They made it to the entrance)

Everyone: YEAH!

Mordecai: We're gonna make it!

(The Night Owl comes right in the middle of there path)

Everyone: AHH!

Rigby: It's The Night Owl!

Muscle Man: Get out of the way, jerkface! We need to use your time machine!

(The Night Owl beams lasers to them.)

Everyone: AHH!

(While beaming the lasers they tried dodging it.)

The Night Owl: You can't leave this place, I froze you thousands of years ago. I made what you are and what you always must be: Ice cubes in my drink of success. NOW GET BACK INTO YOUR GLASS!

(They still go for the time machine, then crack The Night Owl's suit and leave him there)

~ Select year of contest. ~

(Muscle Man throws an item to the Day One button)

~ "Day One of contest" selected. ~

(They all try to leave at the exit)

The Night Owl: NOOOO!

(Mordecai, Muscle Man, Rigby, and High-Fives finally made to the past/present)

Past Night Owl: Let's see. Awesome idea for a contest, check. Cool prize for a contest. Check. And enough liquid nitrogen to make sure contest lasts long enough to make me famous, check. (evil laugh)

(The scene is cut to show the sky leading up to the transport they have to come to the past/present while they crash and destroy The Night Owl's billboard and the car as the prize)

The Night Owl: NOOOO! My car!

(Mordecai coughs. Muscle Man kicks the car door to get out while the others get out)

The Night Owl: I maxed out my student loans for that car! You're gonna have to pay for tha--!

(Muscle Man punches him in the face while The Night Owl falls to the ground)

Muscle Man: That's for freezing us on purpose.

(They leave him alone)

The Night Owl: (weakly) Uhh...

(Cut scene to Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man & High-Fives)

Mordecai: Man, I'm glad that's over with.

Muscle Man: Yeah, that contest blew lungs.

Rigby: Hey, you don't think we'll run into to our past selves, do you?

Mordecai: Nah, you can't exist with yourself in any given moment in time, it doesn't work that way.

Rigby: Oh, okay, I guess that makes sense.

Muscle Man: And if it does work that way, we can always just fight to the death with each of our copies.

(Everyone laughs)

(Their past selves heard what Muscle Man said and are now shocked at their present selves)

Past Mordecai: Uhh.....

Rigby: Uggggggggggghh!

Mordecai: C'mon, Rigby, it will be over before you know it.

Rigby: Man, I hate cleaning the fountain! It's like the worst job at The Park! Why do we have to clean it anyways, isn't that what rain is for?!

Mordecai: I know, dude, but we just gotta power through it. Here, I'll turn off the water, you start the hose.

Rigby: What?! Why do I have to start the hose?!

Mordecai: It's your turn.

Rigby: My turn, your turn, what's the difference? We're a team, man.

Mordecai: Then man up and do it for the team.

Rigby: Rock, paper, scissors for who starts the hose.

Mordecai: Fine.

(They play rock, paper, scissors. Mordecai gets scissors and Rigby gets paper.)

Rigby: Two out of three?

Mordecai: Start the hose!

Rigby: (angrily mocking Mordecai) "Start the hose."

(Mordecai turns off the fountain and Rigby puts the hose inside the fountain. Rigby sighs, then puts his mouth on the hose and accidentally sucks in the water.)

Rigby: (spitting out the water) Blegh! It tastes like how Muscle Man smells!

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. But check out all this free stuff.

Rigby: All right, what's it gonna be this time?

(They find the baby ducks in the fountain among with some trash)

Rigby: A bunch of baby ducks?

Mordecai: We must have stranded them when we drained the water.

(Mordecai tries to catch them but they run away)

Mordecai: C'mon, dude, help me get them out! We can't clean the fountain with them still in it!

(Mordecai and Rigby try to catch them but they can't keep up with the ducks.)

(The Baby Ducks start chirping)

Mordecai: Get the bucket.

(Mordecai chases the ducks into a bucket. Rigby and Mordecai dump the ducks out of the bucket)

Mordecai: I wonder what they were doing in there all alone.

Rigby: Maybe their mom got scared off or something.

Mordecai: Ready to get back to work?

Rigby: I guess.

(Rigby tries to walk away, but the baby ducks keep following him).

Rigby: I think they're following me!

Mordecai: Haha, dude! They imprinted on you!

Rigby: What?!

Mordecai: Haha, they did! They totally think you're their mom!

Rigby: Stop it!

(Rigby tries to run away from the ducks while Mordecai is laughing at him).

Rigby: Quit following me! I'm not a duck!

Mordecai: Haha! What are you doing? Trying to teach them how to suck at football?

Rigby: Shut up!

(Rigby keeps trying to run away and spins around in circles from the ducks and bumps into Benson)

Benson: Are you two finished cleaning the fountain yet?

Rigby: We're working on it.

Benson: Oh really? Because it looks like you're just playing with a bunch of baby ducks!

Mordecai: We're not playing! We found them in the fountain!

Rigby: Now they won't stop following me.

Mordecai: They imprinted on Rigby.

Benson: Ha! They think Rigby is their mom? Haha! That's the saddest thing I ever heard!

Mordecai: No, I think someone naming their kid Rigby is the saddest thing I ever heard.

Rigby: Hey!

Mordecai: Pfft, just kidding. But seriously, we can't clean this fountain if we're babysitting these ducks.

Benson: Alright, fine. Find a place for those ducks and get back to work, and don't slack off. You still need to clean the park truck when you're done.

(Benson walks away)

Rigby: Aw, man! How do we get rid of these ducks?

Mordecai: Easy. Chicks.

(Scene changes to Mordecai and Rigby at the Coffee Shop)

Rigby: Uggggh! Where are they?!?

Mordecai: Relax! They'll be out in a minute.

(three of the baby ducks jump into Rigby's cereal bowl)

Rigby: Get out of my cereal!

Mordecai: Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Rigby: Oh, thanks a lot. You're a real pal. (walks away from the table) Hm, hm, hm. Step off! Step off! You don't want none of this!

Margaret and Eileen: Awwww!

Eileen: Who are your little pals, Rigby?

Rigby: Little pals? More like little jerks! Look what they did to my cereal! (angrily points to cereal)

Eileen: Aw! They made a baby duck milk waterfall.

Rigby: Get away from me!

Margaret: Aw, look! Now they're copying you!

Rigby: Uggggh!

Margaret: What's the matter, don't you like them?

Eileen: (holding a duck) Is Rigby ignoring you because you're not a beautiful swan yet?

Mordecai: Err... Well we found them at the park and we're supposed to get rid of them. Actually, we were thinking maybe you guys could use some baby ducks!

Margaret: No pets allowed in my building.

Eileen: (suddenly covered in spots) And I'm allergic to duck dander.

Margaret: I bet the Animal Shelter could find them a good home!

(Scene goes to the Animal Shelter)

Animal Shelter Receptionist: Can I help you?

Mordecai: Err... We found these baby ducks and we-

Rigby: (interrupting) We wanna get rid of 'em. (Mordecai angrily punches Rigby) Uggh!

Mordecai: We want to find them a good home.

Animal Shelter Receptionist: Alright, I'm going to need you to fill out some paper work. You can start by... Are those ducks karate chopping each other?

(Ducks karate chopping each other)

Rigby: Er... No.

(Ducks beat up a dog and it crawls into a corner whimpering)

Animal Shelter Receptionist: I'm sorry, we can't take violent animals.

Mordecai: Aw, what? They're not violent!

Rigby: Yeah, man, they were just playing around!

Animal Shelter Receptionist: Those ducks are thugs.

Rigby: You know, some people would think karate chopping was really cool!

(The Ducks karate chop the leg off a table, smashing a tank from which a snake crawls out. They karate chop it into either death or unconsciousness. Later, Mordecai, Rigby and the ducks walk out of the Animal Shelter building)

Rigby: Now what are we gonna do?

Mordecai: I guess we're just gonna have to find someone cool to take them.

Rigby: That shouldn't be a problem. Check this out.

(Rigby punches the air above the Ducks)

Rigby: They're not even flinching!

Mordecai: That is pretty cool.

Rigby: Yea-yuh! And they're fast learners, too.

(The Ducks punch at each other)

Mordecai: Dude! These ducks are awesome!

Rigby: Yeah, man! We can't just give them to some loser!

Mordecai: Don't worry, we'll find somebody to take them. Video game break?

Rigby: Video game break!

(Scene goes to Mordecai, Rigby and the Ducks on the house sofa. On the game, two monsters are fighting. The one on the left wins without any real competition.)

Mordecai and the Ducks: OOOOOOOHHH!

Mordecai: Ha ha ha! Dude, this is crazy! That's the third time in a row that they beat you!

Rigby: It's not my fault! I told you this controller's busted.

Ducks: Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm!

Rigby: Uggh! Step off! Step off!

Mordecai: I don't know, man. I think there's something special about these ducks. Maybe we shouldn't give them away.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: I don't know. I mean, maybe we should keep them.

Benson: (coming into the room) What was that?

Mordecai: Huh? Oh, hey, Benson. We were just saying maybe we should keep... looking for someone to keep... these ducks!

Rigby: Yeah! Yeah, that's it!

Benson: Are you guys done cleaning the fountain?

Mordecai: Oh, well, no. Because we're still looking for people to take these ducks.

Benson: I don't care! Find someone to take care of these ducks right now and get back to work or you're fired!

(Benson angrily leaves the room)

Baby Ducks: OOOOOOHHH!!!

Mordecai: Not cool, guys.

(Scene changes to Mordecai, Rigby and the ducks in the kitchen sitting at the table. Mordecai finishes a flier for the baby ducks and shows Rigby)

Mordecai: Okay, how about this?

Rigby: Man, I dunno. Fliers? The only people who are gonna see these are some creepy old dudes in the park. We can't just give the ducks to some loser.

Mordecai: Come on, dude, we have to do what Benson said. Besides, someone cool will take the ducks, you'll see. It's the right thing to do.

Rigby: Alright, let's go put these things up.

(Scene changes to outside of the house. The baby ducks are swimming in a kiddy pool and Mordecai and Rigby are sitting on the stairs at the front. The duck collector arrives at the house in a green truck and Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector walk up to each other. The baby ducks are seen beating each other.)

Duck Collector: I like the looks of these babies. Here. (he opens up a cooler so the ducks will go in)

Mordecai and Rigby: No.

(The Duck Collector closes his cooler and the scene changes back to where Mordecai is sitting on the stairs, and Rigby is in the pool sitting on a pool ring with the baby ducks)

Mordecai: Let's face it. These ducks are too cool. We're not gonna be able to find someone who we can trust to take care of them.

Rigby: See, I told you.

Mordecai: I don't hear you come up with any great ideas (a jet of water is squirted at Mordecai). Hey, cut it out!

Rigby: Hahahahahaha! (keeps squirting water at Mordecai with his hand)

(The bunch of baby ducks are mimicking Rigby and squirting water at each other)

Rigby: Maybe we can keep the ducks if we just hide them from Benson.

Mordecai: There's no way! He'd find them anywhere.

Rigby: Not if we hide them in plain sight. They can stay in the bathtub and I'll train them to act like rubber duckies. Like this.

(Rigby makes a face of a rubber ducky and the baby ducks copy Rigby's face)

Mordecai: Dude, that could actually work.

Rigby: Okay, now squeeze me so I can train them to squeak.

Pops (standing at the porch): Mordecai and Rigby! Telephone call for you inside!

Mordecai (picks up the phone): Hello?

Mother Duck (voice): Um yeah hello, I'm calling about your ad. Are these ducks small and fluffy and yellow?

Mordecai: Yes.

Mother Duck: Ohhh, my babies! Thank goodness. I leave the fountain for one minute and next thing I know they're gone.

Mordecai (covering transmitter on the phone): It's their mom. She wants her babies back.

Rigby: Tell her "no". We got the rubber duck plan all worked out!

Mordecai: Come on, Rigby, think about it. We don't know anything about raising ducks.

Rigby: It can't be that hard.

Mordecai: You can't even feed yourself. How are you gonna feed a bunch of ducks?

Rigby (his stomach grumbles): Good point. I don't think I've fed them at all yet. Have you?

Mordecai (returns to the phone): When do you wanna pick them up?

Mother Duck: I'll be right over.

(Mordecai and Rigby are walking out of the house)

Rigby: Do you even know what they eat?

Mordecai: I feel like dog food might...

(The duck collector is seen loading the baby ducks into his cooler)

Mordecai: Hey!

Rigby: Stop!

Mordecai: We shouldn't have left them alone!

(The duck collector rushes off to his truck while Mordecai and Rigby chase after him but Mordecai slips and falls into the kiddy pool. The duck collector tosses the cooler into the back of the truck and the ducks are heard chirping inside. Mordecai and Rigby run up to the front of the truck)

Mordecai: (banging on the truck window): Hey! Open the door!

Rigby (climbing up the hood of the truck and banging on the windscreen): We want our baby ducks back!

Duck Collector: Oh, I think you mean my baby ducks. Sure was mighty kind of you boys to hand them over so nicely!

(The duck collector starts the ignition of the truck using a key with a duck chain on it. The windscreen wipers are activated and knocks Rigby of the truck and falls to the ground and Rigby grunts in pain)

Duck Collector: Ta ta! (waves and drives off)

(Mordecai walks and stops. Rigby runs up to Mordecai)

Mordecai: This isn't over. Uh-oh.

(Mother Duck is flying over to Mordecai and Rigby and lands in the kiddy pool. Mordecai and RIgby walk over to Mother Duck)

Mother Duck: Where are my babies?

Rigby: That guy just took 'em!

Mother Duck (jumps out of kiddy pool): What?

Mordecai (about to walk away): I'll get the cart!

Mother Duck: There's no time for carts! Hurry, get on!

Mordecai: Uhh, are you sure that's... I mean I dunno if...

Mother Duck: Get on!

(Mordecai is sitting himself on Mother Duck)

Rigby: Whoa whoa whoa! I'm not sittin' behind you.

Mordecai: Dude, just sit in the back.

Rigby: You sit in the back!

Mordecai: Let's play rock, paper, scissors for it.

(They play rock, paper, scissors. Mordecai gets rock and Rigby gets scissors)

Rigby: Aaagh!

(Rigby sits behind Mordecai and Mother Duck takes off)

Mother Duck: Where'd he go?

Rigby: Over there!

(The duck collector's truck is seen driving and Mother Duck dives down as Mordecai and Rigby are screaming. Mordecai jumps off Mother Duck onto the top of the truck and the Duck Collector hears from inside. The Duck Collector swerves as Rigby just lands on top of the truck, but is hanging from the edge. Rigby struggles, but Mordecai holds Rigby's hand and lifts Rigby up on top. Mordecai runs across to the open window and swings in where the Duck Collector is sitting and kicks the Duck Collector. Rigby jumps in and tries to push the Duck Collector away. Mordecai manages to punch the Duck Collector, causing the truck to rotate, but the Duck Collector pushes Mordecai and Rigby across the area of the driver's room.)

Rigby: Give me back my ducks!

(Rigby gets a hold of the Duck Collector's head and slams it on the driver's wheel several times and the Duck Collector punches Rigby. Mordecai comes up and punches the Duck Collector, causing his hat to fall off, and Mordecai and the Duck Collector push each other for the control of the driver's wheel. Rigby holds onto the wheel and spins it right, and the truck tumbles and Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector are screaming. The park's fountain is destroyed by the tumbling truck, and stops with its top on the ground and smoke emerging from the bottom of the truck. Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector fight, and Mordecai is kicked and crashes into a tree. The baby ducks watch Mordecai crashing and walk over to him. The Duck Collector gets up and Rigby rolls away. Mother Duck flies in to attack the Duck Collector and pecks him on the head, and Mother Duck is knocked unconscious. The baby ducks look worried and Rigby pulls his fists in front of him ready to fight)

Duck Collector: I'm taking those ducks.

(The Duck Collector draws a sword from his cane and threatens Rigby with it, and Rigby shuffles backwards whimpering in fear)

Mordecai: Rigby!

(Rigby backs away and the baby ducks' eyes shine red in fury and all transform into a giant with a duck's head. Mordecai, Rigby and the Duck Collector look up to the duck giant in shock. The scenery has a slight tinge of orange)

Duck Giant: Step off!

(Duck Giant's hand engulfs in flames and karate chops the Duck Collector into half. A huge explosion occurs and the scenery is all clear again. The Duck Giant transforms back into the baby ducks all chirping casually and Mordecai and Rigby are still shocked. The baby ducks run over to Mordecai and Rigby and jump up and down)

Rigby: You guys are so cool!

(The scene changes with the destroyed park fountain and the truck in the background. The baby ducks are cradled in Rigby's arms and Mordecai and Mother Duck are standing)

Rigby: We're really gonna miss you guys!

Mordecai: Yeah, take it easy, guys!

Rigby: Remember what we taught you! High five?

(Rigby holds out his hand and the baby ducks fist bump it. Mother Duck and the baby ducks are walking away)

Mordecai: And keep practicing your video games if you ever want to make a living at it!

Baby Duck: Hey, Mordecai and Rigby, thanks.

(The rest of the baby ducks face Mordecai and Rigby. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other and smile. )

Baby Duck: For being the coolest losers we knowww!

Baby Ducks (waving): OOOOOHHH!!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooooooaahhhhhh!!

(Mother Duck walks away and takes flight while the baby ducks follow. Mordecai and Rigby are waving. They turn around behind themselves smiling and see Benson frowning. Mordecai and Rigby stop smiling and look a bit worried)

Mordecai: Woa-hoh, hey, Benson. Alright, so there's good news and bad news. The good news is that the ducks' mom came back and picked them up! The bad news is the fountain is destroyed. So we're probably gonna need another chore to do. Is there any other things that might need cleaning?

(Benson walks away still frowning)

Mordecai: Benson?

Rigby: You're probably wondering why I brought you here today.

Mordecai: Not really.

Rigby: Check it. All the richest people in history have drinks named after them. Shirley Temple, Arnold Palmer, John F. Lemonade. What drink's gonna make me rich you ask? I'll tell you what. (fixes up a drink) One can of RadiCola, frozen fruit juice concentrate, a dash of hot sauce... (Mordecai looks disgusted) Sugar Roasted Sugar Bombs for texture, and the rest... (adds some fruits and fish bones, followed by pickles) Mordecai, witness The RigJuice!

Mordecai: Dude, I don't think you should drink that.

Rigby: (drinks his RigJuice, then coughs wildly) Whoa... my face feels like magic. Dude, wanna taste?

Mordecai: Pfft, yeah right. I'm not dumb enough to drink that stuff.

Rigby: Come on, we do dumb stuff all the time! We're like two peas in a pod.

Mordecai: Uhh-huh no.. I'm definitely smarter than you. It's been that way ever since you dropped out of high school.

Rigby: Dude, what? I don't need no high school education. You can't use everything from school in everyday life.

(Benson walks in with some tools.)

Benson: Hey, Mordecai and Rigby. I got a question for you. You know those six box turtles at the park petting zoo? Each of those turtles needs a turtle fence. Assuming each turtle needs nine square feet of space, I need you guys to figure out the minimum number, of nine foot planks to use for construction.

Rigby: (confused) Uh...

Mordecai: Whoa, Whoa, slow down, Benson. Rigby can't answer that question. He doesn't have a high school diploma.

Benson: You don't have a diploma? Thanks for wasting my time. Where's Skips? I'll go ask him.

Muscle Man: Ask Skips what?

Mordecai: Oh, just about some math problem that Rigby doesn't know how to solve.

Rigby: STOP TALKING!!! Just because I couldn't solve some math problem, doesn't make you more smarter than me!

Muscle Man: Check that grammar, bro.

Rigby: Huh?

Muscle Man: "More Smart", not "More Smarter".

Hi Five Ghost: Didn't you learn that in high school?

Rigby: LEARN THIS!! A high school diploma never got nobody nothin' and that's a fact!

(A horn honks as a Burger Bros. truck stop by.)

Worker: Free Burgers! Free Burgers for all high school graduates!

Muscle Man: Whoo! I'm a high school graduate! I got my diploma right here!

Mordecai: Yeah-yuhhh!

Pops: (Laughs)

(Everyone else except Rigby line up for burgers, as Rigby watches from the computer room window in shock.)

Rigby: NOOO! (writes fake diploma, dashes out of the computer room, and runs outside) No, wait! I've got my diploma! (Trucker closes and leaves) Come baack...!

Mordecai: You misspelled "Diploma" dude.

Rigby: Huh? (looks at fake diploma seeing he spelled it like "Diplowma") That's it! I'm going back to high school!

Mordecai: Eh, doesn't sound like a good idea to me. Our friendship wouldn't work if we're both smart.

Rigby: What? What are you talking about? We're both the same amount of smart as each other!

Mordecai: No, you're not. I'm the smart one, and you're my friend. That's our dynamic, dude. I have a high school diploma and you don't.

Rigby: I'm gonna get my diploma, and then we'll see how you like being the dumb one! (We cut to Rigby's old High School, a bell rings. We then zoom out inside the classroom.)

Teacher: (off-screen) Well, class, this is quite possibly the hardest math problem (on-screen) in the world, Whoever can solve it, will be leaving the classroom today with a diploma in their hands.

(Many students whisper Rigby's name, thinking he'll try to solve it.)

Rigby: Did you say diploma?

(Rigby solves the problem)

Teacher: That...is correct! (gives Rigby his diploma) Congratulations, Rigby, you won't need to go near another school for the rest of your life!

Teacher and Rigby: OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO-

(We cut to Rigby, asleep, with drool on his face)

Rigby: oooooooo-

Teacher: RIGBY!

Rigby: Huh? Wha?

(The class laughs, and the teacher is not amused.)

Rigby: Uhhh...Can I get my diploma now?

Teacher: Get out of my class, Rigby. (Back at Pops's house, we see Mordecai playing video games, Rigby starts walking up the stairs)

Mordecai: You fell asleep in class, didn't you?

Rigby: SHUT UP!

Mordecai: You wouldn't fall asleep so much if you had your High School diploma.

Rigby: Grrrr!

(We cut to Rigby typing and clicking)

Rigby: The lousy High School diploma. I can get my diploma the easy way, online.

Computer Voice: Welcome to the Education Mentor. Get your diploma now by taking our online test.

Rigby: Hmm! Hmm! I got this. Bam!

Computer Voice: First question: Which of the following is not a square?

Rigby: Gah... This is too hard. (Rigby throws his chair off screen while screaming in rage, he starts shaking the computer) I WANT MY DIPLOMA! (Ads come up as a result of his rage) Ugh! Ads, go away, now! (He starts closing ads, but he rests on one) Huh? BrainMax? Increase your intelligence? More smarter. (Clock transition to Rigby opening his BrainMax) Welcome to the BrainMax system. Instructions: Take one tablespoon a day. Do not take if pregnant, or one hour after heavy thinking. Will see results in thirty to forty days? What?! I'll just drink a month's worth of doses, I mean it doesn't say not to. (drinks the BrainMax. The bottle says "Use Only As Directed". Rigby groans as his head starts pounding. Plenty of scientific words Go Inside Rigby's brain.) Whoa. (Rigby looks at the Computer) I know this now. Wait a minute. I know everything.

(Scene changes to the living room where Rigby is doing a 'Smart Guy Quarterly crossword puzzle.)

Mordecai: Hey, I know something that can help you with that crossword. It's called a high school diploma.

Rigby: Very amusing, Mordecai. All merriment aside. Perhaps you can assist me with this. What's an eight letter word for idiot?

Mordecai: What? Why are you talking like that?

Rigby: I tried "imbecile", "bonehead", "pea-brain", Oh wait! I got it. "Mordecai".

Mordecai: You're the idiot, you... (counts his fingers to see how many letters the word has before he says it) dumb-face!

Rigby: Hmm. I'm afraid while "dumb-face" fits, it's simply too stupid for this puzzle. Face it Mordecai, I'm the smartest now.

(Rigby drinks the BrainMax)

Mordecai: What is that? That isn't RigJuice. (Mordecai takes the BrainMax out of Rigby's hands) BrainMax?

(Rigby tries to get it back)

Rigby: Get your hands off that! Gimme that!

(Mordecai pushes Rigby away. He laughs and takes a sip and now feels pain in his head, shocking Rigby)

Mordecai: First of all, I wanna contradict your earlier statement. (Mordecai writes a math problem on the living room window) This theory proves you're dumber than me.

Rigby: Ha! (Rigby takes the BrainMax away from Mordecai and takes a sip) As you can see by my encounter theory, it is you, that you are dumber than me.

(Mordecai takes the BrainMax away)

Mordecai: Tsk. Tsk. Wait till you see my 20 page research paper backing up my theory.

(Rigby takes the BrainMax away)

Rigby: Tsk. Tsk. I'm gonna write a 21 page paper backing up my theory. AND prove yours wrong!

Mordecai: Tsk. Tsk. Is that so?

Rigby: Tsk. Tsk. Yeah!

(Mordecai and Rigby are saying "Tsk. Tsk" repeatedly. A montage starts going on when they are trying to prove each other that they're smarter than each other by drinking more BrainMax and putting many more theorys around the house with corrections and writings everywhere and then the montage stops where Mordecai and Rigby are in a room, where more words are going through their head)

Mordecai: In closing, your theories had failed to prove that you're smarter. For your brain is no bigger than a walnut.

(The word 'walnut' hits Rigby.)

Rigby: Very funny Mordecai, but your paper is fundamentally flawed because your brain is made of 99% K9 butt cheeks.

(The words 'butt cheeks' hits Mordecai.)

Mordecai: There is still one fuerable truth. You don't have a High School diploma, so I'm smarter than you. You imbecile.

(The word 'imbecile' than hits Rigby and suddenly takes away the background of the house.)

Rigby: GAHH! I am not an imbecile! (Opens door to the computer) If a diploma will prove that I'm smarter than you, than so be it! (Confused and sees the computer differently) huh? Ahh! I can't read it!

Mordecai: Probably because you're still too stupid. (Comes to the computer) Here. Huh? What kind of writing is this?

(Normal world where Benson, Skips and Pops come in to the room where all their theories were shown.)

Benson: Mordecai. Rigby. You guys- huh? (Sees the theories they did) (angrily) AHH! (off-screen) Mordecai, Rigby, (on-screen) get downstairs right now (turns red) and clean down the mess you made, (off-screen) or i'm gonna fire- (Mordecai And Rigby don't know what Benson is saying due to the BrainMax they drank.)

Rigby: (to Mordecai) Dude, what is he saying?

(Both of them see them differently as what they're saying and how they look.)

Mordecai: Oh no. We've become so smart, they're stupid to us.

(In the normal world, Benson, Skips and Pops hear Mordecai and Rigby in Latin.)

Mordecai: Quārum hī vitiō moriānis?

Rigby: Moriānis?! Moriānis vestris incipi(v)it rem tōtam!

Mordecai: Et herem facĕre debēre īre stultum.

(Back to Mordecai and Rigby's perspective.)

Rigby: If you haven't made fun of me so much, none of this would've happened!

Mordecai: Whatever. You can't even get your diploma, because we're so smart. So, what's the point?

Rigby: You're right. There is no point.

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: What's the point of being so smart, if you can't even under- (off-screen) -stand anyone? (on-screen) We have to get stupid again.

Mordecai: How?

Rigby: ...RigJuice.

Mordecai: The fridge! (Mordecai and Rigby float to the fridge.)

(Scene then shows Muscle Man and High-Fives in a different way too while Muscle Man is eating.)

(Rigby opened the fridge.)

Rigby: Ah ha! The RigJuice!

Mordecai: Pour me some.

(Rigby pours the RigJuice to his cup which shows how the material is made out of.)

Rigby: Whoa... It looks... different now.

Mordecai: Ready?

Rigby: Wait. If I drink this, I'll never get my diploma.

Mordecai: Dude, it's just a piece of paper.

Rigby: I know that, but you'll never stop making fun of me for it.

Mordecai: I don't care. I won't make fun of you anymore. I promise. To being stupid?

(Little silence appears)

Rigby: To being stupid. Bottoms up.

(Mordecai and Rigby made the toast and drink the RigJuice.)

(Little silence appears again to see what happens.)

Rigby: ..Did that work?

(Suddenly, Mordecai and Rigby fall.)

(Mordecai and Rigby scream while falling and their intelligence starts to go away when now Benson appears normally now.)

Benson: -And if you don't stop goofing off and clean up this graffiti now, I'm gonna tear you limb from limb!

Mordecai and Rigby: Huh...?

Benson: Do you have anything to say for yourselves?

Rigby: What just happened...?

Mordecai: Uhh...I don't remember anything...

Muscle Man: Me and Fives were practicing for our pie contest, when you dudes came and were speaking Spanish or something. (begins to eat his pie again.)

Hi-Fives: Then you drink that green stuff.

Mordecai: Ugh! I can't believe you got me to drink your lame drink.

Benson: Better get started, or it's coming out of your paycheck.

Muscle Man: Yeah, losers.

(Muscle Man, High-Fives and Benson leave the room.)

Mordecai: You know, maybe if you had a High School diploma, we wouldn't be in this mess.

Rigby: Well, guess what? This drop out somehow got you to drink RigJuice.

(Mordecai gets up.)

Mordecai: (awes)...I'll get the paint.

(Mordecai leaves the room.)

(Rigby gets the jug of the RigJuice, looks back and forth to see if someone's watching then takes a sip of it.)

Rigby: (awes)...That's good RigJuice.

Mordecai: *awes* Alright, dude, time to get up. (Rigby whines) Come on, Rigby. (Rigby whines more.) Dude, get up. We gotta get ready for work.

Rigby: (sits up) Okay, okay. (grunts)

Mordecai: (stands up) Dude, this is so cool. I never got a job that got you a place to live.

Rigby: I never even had a job.

(Rigby gets the dirty clothes off of him while Mordecai is watching him struggle getting it off.)

Mordecai: Yeah, about that. (Rigby gets up and puts the dirty clothing in one corner.) I kinda told them you'd be a good idea to hire, so can you try not to do the whole "Rigby thing".

Rigby: "Rigby thing"? What do you mean?

Mordecai: I mean you're lazy.

Rigby: What? I'm not lazy.

Mordecai: Dude, you were too lazy to fill up the application for this job. That's why I had to vouch for you in the first place.

Rigby: (angrily) Just because I was too lazy to do something boring like filling in a job application doesn't mean I'm lazy.

Mordecai: Okay. Okay. Look. Let's just both promise that starting right now we're not gonna do anything to screw this up. Okay?

Rigby: Okay. You think there's breakfast stuff in the kitchen?

(Mordecai thinks...)

Mordecai: Only one way to find out.

(Scene changes in the fridge where Mordecai opens it.)

Mordecai: ...Milk.

(Gets the milk.)

Rigby: ...Cereal.

(Gets the cereal.)

Mordecai & Rigby: ...Combine.

(Mordecai pours the milk & Rigby pours the cereal.)

(Scene changes where they sit down in the kitchen table where Rigby was about to eat his cereal until Mordecai puts his hand in his chest.)

Mordecai: This is the only clean spoon left, dude. Let's play "Punchies" for it.

Rigby: Okay. Me first. (Rigby punches Mordecai but, gets surprised when he thought it was weak. Mordecai laughs then punches Rigby hard in his arm.) Owww. Take it.

Mordecai: (laughs then talks with his mouth full) Man, so far this job is awesome! I still can't believe we get our own rooms!

Rigby: Dude, those rooms aren't cool. There's nothing in 'em. I had to sleep on the floor last night.

(Rigby eats the cereal from the box.)

Mordecai: Well, yeah, I mean, we could get some stuff for it after we make some money. You know?

Rigby: I guess.

Mordecai: You want some milk.

Rigby: Yeah.

(Mordecai pours the milk into Rigby's mouth when all of a sudden benson comes in.)

Benson: Hey! Please don't eat up in the table like that.

Pops: Like what? (Gentle music appears when the scene is shown closer to a chair that Pops & Benson are taking out. Scene then shows Mordecai & Rigby in shock staring at it when they're not even paying attention to what they're doing.) Oh my. I've never seen anyone eating cereal like that. How quaint!

Benson: Yeah, well they shouldn't be doing that. That's what the bowls are for.

Pops: Oh, they're fine!

(Pops & Benson leave the room.)

Mordecai: Did you see that chair?

Rigby: I love chairs.

(They stair at each other and suddenly go outside where Pops & Benson took the chair out.)

Mordecai: Hey, Pops! What are you doing with that chair?

Pops: Oh, well. I no longer require its services. So, Benson & I are taking it to the place where the big man-made come upon & wisk it away to magic trash city!

(Mordecai & Rigby stay silent then look at Benson for an answer.)

Benson: We're throwing it away.

Rigby: Aw, what?

Mordecai: Yeah, why would you throw that thing out? It looks awesome. Can we at least check it out, before you chuck it?

Rigby: (Quickly) Yeah, can we at least check it, before you chuck it?

(Pops & Benson put the chair down.)

Pops: (Laughs) Oh, that would be fine.

(Rigby laughs.)

Mordecai: Yeahhh...

Benson: Look, I gotta get back to work. You guys help him throw it away when you're done.

(Benson leaves the scene while Mordecai & Rigby come closer to the chair.)

Mordecai: Aw, man, this chair is awesome. Look how awesome it looks.

Rigby: Dude, it sounds like old man pants.

(They both feel the couch which makes a cushion sound)

Mordecai: (laughs) I'm gonna sit in it.

Rigby: Good idea.

(Mordecai sits on the couch while awing. Later, he then feels uncomfortable.)

Rigby: What? What's wrong?

(Mordecai positions with the chair in many ways to feel comfortable.)

Mordecai: (quickly) This is the most uncomfortable chair I ever sat in.

Rigby: Aw, what? Let me try it.

Pops: Yes, I'm afraid it's true, I purchased it through the post, and it just isn't as comfortable as it looks.

Rigby: Awwwwwww. This is terrible. Maybe we're just not sitting it right.

Mordecai: Hmm, Hmm.

Rigby: Come on, baby, come on, baby, come on! Come on, baby!!!

(Rigby pull his eyes and bites the chair and sits on the chair)

Rigby: Ugh. It's just not comfortable, man. If you ask me, I think we should throw it away.

Pops: Oh, well, yes, that's what I'm on my way to do.

Mordecai: Hey, Pops, since you're throwing it out anyway, can I just have it?

Rigby: No, let me have it!

Mordecai: I asked him first. Come on, Pops!

Rigby: No, Pops, me!

Pops: Well, I don't think I know who to give it to. But if you two can settle it between yourselves, then you're more than welcome to have it.

Mordecai: Yeah, let's play punches.

Rigby: No way. I'm not playing that game with you anymore. If we're playing for something like that chair, then we need to play a game that takes a little more skill.

Mordecai: How much skill?

Rigby: Rock Paper Scissors.

Pops: Oh, I adore Rock Paper Scissors. Although where I come from, we called it "Quartz Parchment Shears".

Mordecai: Alright, how do you wanna play it. Are we go in a one-two-three go? Or one-two-three, shoot on three?

Rigby: Let's do it on three.

Mordecai: Alright, fine. But let's stretch first. I don't wanna put my hammy or whatever.

Rigby: Okay.

(M&R stretch first for Rock Paper Scissors)

Muscle Man: What's up with the new guys?

Pops: They're getting ready to play Quartz Parchment Shears for my old Silounna.

Muscle Man: Nice. You know who else is gonna play Quartz Parchment Shears for your old Silounna?

Pops: Who?

Muscle Man: My mom!

(Pops, Hi Five Ghost and Muscle Man laugh)

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost give a high five)

Muscle Man: See? I told you I was gonna say it!

Mordecai: Ready?

Rigby: Hmm.

(Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears one tie)

Pops: Oh, my!

(Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors two ties and Pops laugh)

Benson: Shouldn't you guys be throwing that thing away?

Pops: Benson, come quick! Quartz Parchment Shears and they've already tied two times, it's absolutely fascinating!

Benson: I have work to do. And they shouldn't be playing that. It's an evil game.

Pops: Whoo, an evil game.

Rigby: Two ties. You don't know what I'm throwing next, baby.

Mordecai: Pfft. I already know what you're gonna throw before you even throw it, baby.

Rigby: That's not even possible, baby!

(Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors eight ties and Pops watches in amazement; Rigby kicks the dirt)

Mordecai: Come on! (He walks away)

Pops: Good show! Jolly good show! (He pulls out a walkie talkie) Everyone, come quick! The most amazing game of Quartz Parchment Shears is happening right now! (laughs)

(Montage begins where Mordecai and Rigby play quartz parchment shears 99 ties and Pops watches in shock until the montage ends. A crowd of people are yelling as they watch Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors)

Rigby: La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la!

Mordecai: No! No! No!

Pops: Ninety-nine times in a row! (laughs)

Mordecai: Enough! Why are we even doing this? You don't think this chair is comfortable.

Rigby: So? Neither do you!

Mordecai: Dude, I was lying. I was just saying it so you wouldn't want it.

Rigby: I was lying also. I love that chair!

Mordecai: Well, then, I guess it's too bad, because after I win it, I'm never gonna let you sit in it.

Rigby: (groans) Then finish it.

(Mordecai and Rigby play Rock Paper Scissors 100 ties, but lightning, thunder and an evil voice laughing is heard from the sky)

Evil Voice: Since no one can decide, and all is played is tied 100 times, I'd take it upon myself to eat your prize.

(A black hole appears in front of them, and the people run to the house for safety)

Rigby: What is that?!

Mordecai: Come on, let's go!

(They go to the house for safety, except a business man, who gets sucked into the black hole)

Rigby: This is all your fault!

Mordecai: How is this my fault?! I just wanted to play punchies!

(They see the chair about to be sucked into the black hole)

Rigby: The chair! (He goes after the chair)

Mordecai: Rigby! (He goes after Rigby)

Pops: Oh? Oh! Oh, dear. (He goes after the duo to save the chair)

(Cut to a different area of the park where Benson and Skips are driving in the cart)

Pops: (over the speaker) Hello, hello? Please, someone, come quick! Quartz Parchment Shears has gone terribly wro--- (The speaker dies)

Benson: Pops, where are you? (He and Skips see an explosion behind the bushes; sighs) Skips, take the shortcut, I'll go around back.

Skips: Hmm.

(He takes the shortcut through the bushes and Benson drives the cart back to the guys)

Benson: Idiots.

(Rigby, Mordecai and Pops hold on a lamppost as they're screaming, trying to save the chair, but the black hole monster reveals itself and roars and goes back into the black hole, and it gets bigger and stronger, making Pops let go of the lamppost, and as the trio are about to be sucked into the black hole, Skips grabs Pops' legs)

Pops: Skips!

Skips: What did you do?

Benson: (he came with the he cart) They were playing Rock Paper Scissors, grab on.

Skips: (he grabs on a bar) Don't you know that's an evil game?

Benson: Hold on, everybody!

Pops: Hold on, everybody!

Mordecai: Hold on, every... Rigby!

(Half of Rigby's body is sucked into the black hole along with the chair, and Benson and Skips gasp, but Benson drives the cart towards the garage door, pulling half of Rigby's body and the chair out of the black hole, and Benson continues driving until he hits the garage door)

Skips: What do we do?

Benson: You have to break the tie!

Mordecai: Rigby, we have to end this! I'm gonna throw rock!

Rigby: Yeah, right.

Mordecai: I'm not kidding!

Benson: Hurry up! Do it now!

(Mordecai and Rigby breaks the tie, causing the black hole to explode, leaving the park ruined. Everybody gets up)

Mordecai: Did you win?

Rigby: (coughs)

Mordecai: I think you've won.

Rigby: (sighs) It doesn't matter. I wasn't able to hold on to the chair anyways.

Pops: Look!

(Half of the chair is still left)

Mordecai & Rigby: Aw, cool.

Benson: No, you don't. You're not getting that chair. But here's what you do get. You get to flip that cart back over, you're throwin' that chair away, and then you're cleanin' up this whole MESS! (the camera zooms out, revealing the entire lawn destroyed) Pops, you're comin' with me. And you two idiots, if this isn't cleaned up when I get back, YOU'RE FIRED!

(Benson walks into the house with Pops and Skips before he slams the door shut)

Mordecai: Okay, starting now, let's both promise not to do anything to screw this up. Agreed?

Rigby: Agreed. Rock Paper Sissors for who gets to drive the cart? (both shake their fists, attempting who gets to drive it first)

Mordecai: Dude! Get off the computer, Muscle Man! Read the sign-up sheet! We're signed up for 1:30!

Muscle Man: Hey, chill out, you jerks! We still have 5 minutes. (pushes Mordecai & Rigby away) Go wait in the lounge.

Rigby: Fine! 5 minutes!

(Mordecai and Rigby sit on chairs in the Computer Waiting Lounge)

Muscle Man: Aw, yeah! More internet videos!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost play the Old Man Horseshoes video. In the video, an old man is playing horseshoes, but gets struck by lightning and turns into a pile of ashes)

Muscle Man: (laughs) Old Man Horseshoes, you're pathetic! (Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost laugh)

Rigby: I saw that one coming.

Hi Five Ghost: Oh, dude! Road Hog!

Muscle Man: Oh yeah! That's a good one!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost play the Road Hog video. In the video, Road Hog attempts to drive his car across a canyon, but he fails and crashes into the other edge of the canyon. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost laugh)

Muscle Man: (notices Mordecai and Rigby grimacing at him) This is some hilarious stuff, losers! It's got a setup, a punchline, a dude gets hurt! Come on!

Mordecai: Still not funny.

Muscle Man: Get over here!

(Mordecai and Rigby move their chairs over to the computer)

Muscle Man: (typing) You guys are gonna thank me for this.

(A video plays where a guy is drinking soda. Wedgie Ninja sneaks behind him and gives him a wedgie. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost laugh)

Mordecai: I-(interrupted by Muscle Man)

Muscle Man: Uh uh uh! Wait for it...

(Scene goes back to video)

Guy: Why, Wedgie Ninja?

(All of a sudden, a bear falls on the guy and plays the glockenspiel. Then he farts on the guy)

Guy: Oh, my back!

(Scene changes back to computer room, where Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are seen laughing)

Muscle Man: (laughs) He just farted on that guy's back!

Mordecai: (to a laughing Rigby) Why are you laughing, dude?

Rigby: That dude did get hurt! Plus the bear farted on his back!

Mordecai: Dude! Muscle Man, Wedgie Ninja? Glocken Bear? This viral video stuff is stupid.

Muscle Man: What? Bro, if it's so stupid, why does it have so many hits?

Mordecai: Me and Rigby could come up with a video that gets way more hits than that.

Rigby: Yeah!

Muscle Man: In your dreams! Me and Fives could get way more hits than you dorks.

Mordecai: No you couldn't.

Muscle Man: Yes we could! Ten bucks says we can make a better video than yours by the end of the week.

Mordecai: You're on. (Him and Muscle Man shake hands)

Muscle Man, Mordecai, and Rigby: Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm!

(Begins a montage set to the song "Hit Me With Your Best Shot" by Pat Benatar.  The montage consists of Mordecai, Rigby, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost making viral videos. M and R's videos only get a small number of views, while MM and Hi Five Ghost's videos get a large amount of views. The montage ends and the scene goes to the computer room)

Muscle Man: Pay up, losers!

Mordecai: No way! The week's not even through yet!

Muscle Man: We're like a million views ahead of you! You might as well just give up!

Mordecai: No! We'll have an awesome internet video by the end of the day!

Muscle Man: How much are you going to bet on that?

Mordecai: Double or nothing!

Muscle Man: Aw man! We're gonna be rich!

(The scene changes to outside Pops' House, where M&R are making a viral video)

Mordecai: Okay, best internet video ever! Take one.

Rigby: Wait, what do I do again?

Mordecai: Yeah, so, just start jumping, right? And get some major air. And I don't know, then like, do some awesome backflips or something.

Rigby: (starts jumping) Right. Are you getting this?

(Mordecai thumbs up)

Rigby: Wooo! Wooo! (Rigby starts jumping and kisses his muscles, and pretends to play guitar)

Mordecai: Hmm, still not going high enough. I know, let me try something.

(Mordecai walks onto the trampoline. Mordecai jumps when Rigby hits the trampoline, but Rigby flies to the tree and bangs his head on the branch)

Mordecai: (gasps) Rigby!

Rigby: Ugh!

Mordecai: Dude, are you okay?

Rigby: Dude... that was AWESOME!

Mordecai: That's called a double-jump!

Pops: Is this one of those new fangled movie cameras?

Mordecai: Oh, Pops, You don't wanna touch that, we're trying to make a movie.

Pops: *gasps* Does your movie have sound? Back in my day we used to call those talkies.

Mordecai: Ha'yeah, we're making a movie about jumping on the trampoline.

Pops: We used to call those jumpies. Can I be in your jumpy?

Rigby: Dude, Mordecai, if we put more weight on the trampoline, we could get more air, right?

Mordecai: Yea, ok, but...

(Rigby points to Pops who sees a nickel on the ground)

Pops: Oh, somebody's dropped a shilling!

(Reaches for it and his head lands on the ground with his body in the air and laughs)

Mordecai and Rigby: You wanna be in our movie, Pops?

(Cuts to the three jumping on the trampoline.)

Mordecai: Triple jump!

Pops: Whee! Oh ho ho!

Mordecai: Hmm. I guess that was pretty high. But it wasn't a million views high.

Rigby: What we need is more power.

Mordecai: Yeah. Dude! I know exactly how!

(Cuts to Pops standing on top of the cart, with Mordecai holding a rope, at the top of which is hoisted a refrigerator.)

Mordecai: OK, Pops, you're going to do a double-jump with that refrigerator.

Pops: I'm going to be on the interwebs! Ho ho ho!

Mordecai: Alright, on three. One, two, three!

Rigby: Jump!

(Pops jumps, and flies to the heavens, laughing.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is gold!

Rigby: Wait til Muscle Man sees this!

(Pops screams and laughs, still flying upwards.)

Mordecai: Dude, look how high he's goin'!

(Pops disappears through a loophole in the sky.)

Rigby: Dude, where'd he go?

Mordecai: Don't worry, he'll fall down any second.

Rigby: Dude, he's not comin' down!

Mordecai: Oh, no. Oh no! Dude, we've gotta go get him!

Rigby: What? But we've still got to take care of the viral video.

Mordecai: Dude, he could be dead. I'm going after him and you're coming with me.

(Cuts to Mordecai and Rigby on top of the golf cart, with Mordecai again holding the refrigerator rope. Rigby has the camera.)

Mordecai: Ready?

Rigby: Just a sec. Might as well have a follow-up video.

Mordecai: OK. One, two, three!

(Mordecai and Rigby jump, and fly to the heavens, screaming, disappearing into the loophole. Cuts to Mordecai and Rigby in what looks to be the inside of a computer. Various viral videos are shown on screens.)

Mordecai: Huh?

Rigby: Woah. This footage is gold! We'll definitely beat Muscle Man with this.

Mordecai: Priorities, dude. First we get Pops. Wherever he is.

Rigby: What is this place?

Mordecai: Kinda looks like an insane asylum.

Rigby: Hey, look: it's Wedgie Ninja!

(A screen of Wedgie Ninja is showing.)

Wedgie Ninja: Help me.

Mordecai: What?

Warden of the Internet: What's your name?

Pops: Pops.

Rigby: It's Pops!

Warden of the Internet: Step over to your right, Pops.

Pops: Is this my passport photo for the interwebs?

Warden of the Internet: Sort of.

Pops: Ooh, I love photos. I am ready, madame.

Warden of the Internet: Say 'doomed for eternity.'

Pops: Doomed for eternity! Oh!

Rigby: No!

(Screen of Pops endlessly bouncing on a trampoline shows.)

Mordecai: Who are you and what did you do to Pops?

Warden of the Internet: My job. I'm the warden of the internet. Pops made the mistake of trying to make a viral video.

Mordecai: So?

Warden of the Internet: The internet should be a serious place used for writing research papers and maybe for keeping in touch with relatives once in a while. These silly viral videos are a disease. They must be contained.

Mordecai: Dude, that's not fair.

Rigby: Yeah, we're just trying to make entertaining videos.

Warden of the Internet: Wrong! All these people need to be punished, forced to live their stupidity on repeat forever.

Rigby: You're insane.

Mordecai: It's not even Pops' fault. He was just doing us a favor. Isn't that right, Pops?

Pops: I don't like the interwebs, Mordecai and Rigby!

Warden of the Internet: Wait a minute. Mordecai and Rigby? You're supposed to be in Pops' video. Now I have to reconfigure the laser video transporter for two more criminals that will spend eternity in endless loop for their interweb crimes.

(The screens all pause and the people within ask what's going on.)

Mordecai: Dude, get Pops.

(Rigby runs off screen.)

Mordecai: People of the internet: we're gonna get you out of here but we've gotta leave right now. Go into all the videos and get as many people as you can.

(The video screens all start to evacuate and shrink into the ground.)

Rigby: Pops, jump!

(Pops jumps from his screen into Rigby's arms, and Rigby backs into a red power button, turning the Warden's screen on.)

Warden of the Internet: Crimes! What? You!

Mordecai: Guys! Up here!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Pops escape through a screen. The Warden's screen breaks loose from its cables and chases.)

Rigby: Old man horseshoes!

Mordecai: Come on! Come on!

Warden of the Internet: You'll never get out of here alive!

(They find a car.)

Mordecai: Get in! Wait. Who's driving this?

Rigby: Roadhog!

(They scream as the car drives for the canyon.)

Mordecai: We're gonna die!

Pops: Look!

(A portal appears in the air. Mordecai, Rigby, Pops, and Old man horseshoes jump out of the car and through it. Mordecai is carrying Roadhog. They arrive back in the computer where the viral characters are waiting.)

Mordecai: Alright, everybody. To the portal - quick! Come on, come on! Now you, Pops!

(Pops makes to jump but the Warden grabs him by the ankle with her cables.)

Mordecai: No!

Warden of the Internet: Ha ha ha! Huh?!

Rigby: Wedgie Ninja!

(Wedgie Ninja is giving the Warden a wedgie.)

Wedgie Ninja: I don't know how much longer these panties are gonna hold!

Rigby: But-

Wedgie Ninja: Go, now! Guys... link to my video.

Rigby: We'll never forget you, Wedgie Ninja.

(The Warden's screen explodes as Mordecai, Rigby and Pops tumble into a portal. Cuts to the house. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are sitting on the front steps.)

Muscle Man: Where are those clowns? Probably skipped town because they know they won't win the bet.

(Viral characters tumble from the sky onto the trampoline. Mordecai, Pops, and Rigby land on top)

Muscle Man: What are you guys doin'?

Rigby: Mmmakin' viral videos!

Muscle Man: Huh?!

(Glockenbear falls from the sky, lands on Muscle Man, plays a brief jingle, then farts on Muscle Man's stomach. Camera pans out to a computer screen on WooHoo, where Mordecai and Rigby are watching this on video. Muscle Man is standing next to them.)

Mordecai: Ha ha ha! Oh, man, that's the best part. And two million views cannot deny.

Rigby: You know what else is the best part? Gettin' twenty dollars from this guy!

Mordecai and Rigby: Woaaaaah!

(Several viral characters join in with the woah. Pops laughs.)

Muscle Man: Don't you losers have somewhere to be?

Rigby: (after finding a dead animal, marking a square on the bingo card) Ha-ha, dude, we only need a few more for a bingo! Up high!

Mordecai: This is totally gross, you know. I can't believe Benson made a dead animal bingo card to force us to pick up roadkill.

Rigby: So what? We have to pick up roadkill in the park anyway, it's part of our job. We might as well try to have a little fun while we're doin' it. Besides, Benson said we can stop once we get a bingo, so come on, man! Up high!

Mordecai: Ugh, fine. (gives Rigby a high-five) I still think you're enjoying this too much.

(shows them picking up road-kill, then shows a title card that says 8 hours later)

Mordecai: Dude, I think we've picked everything up.

Rigby: Don't worry dude, we're close. I can smell it! (sniffs) Ah, dude, if you're gonna crack one off in the cart, you could at least warn me!

Mordecai: Dude, it's not me. Look!

(They stop the cart they're in and see a huge skunk in the road, thinking it's dead.)

Mordecai: Ugh, skunk!

Rigby: Wait, skunk?!

(Rigby looks at the bingo card, seeing that finding a skunk can get them a bingo, Rigby gasps)

Rigby: Dude, Bingo!

Mordecai: Bingo?

Rigby: Bing-o-o-o-o-o-o, bing-o-o-o-o-o-o!

Mordecai: Bing-o-o-o-o-o-o!

Mordecai and Rigby: Ohhhhhhhhhhhh!!!

Mordecai: Woahhhhh!!!

Rigby: (walks up to the skunk) Bing-o-o-o-o! Aah!

(The skunk sprays Rigby after waking up, with Mordecai holding his breath and trying to stay out of the stink cloud the skunk has formed)

Mordecai: (gasps; breathing heavily) Rigby?! You okay?

(Rigby coughs)

Skunk: Hey, whoa, whoa, watch it, watch it!

Rigby: What the heck, man?!

Skunk: You guys think you can just walk up to a guy in broad daylight and mug him without him fighting back?

Rigby: We weren't mugging you! We thought you were dead!

Skunk: I was taking a nap!

Rigby: In the middle of the road?!

Skunk: Oh, who are you - Mr. King Sandman, telling people where they can and cannot sleep?!

Mordecai: Sorry, we thought you were dead. We were just excited. We thought we got a bingo.

Skunk: So because you thought I was dead, you thought you got a bingo? What kind of sick game is that?!

Mordecai: It's— our boss made us... Well, okay, look — no bingo. No bingo.

Rigby: Well, how do I get rid of this smell?

Skunk: Ha! You think you just get to turn it off? No, I'm stuck with it, and now so are you.

Rigby: Come on dude, don't be a jerk! Tell me how to get rid of this.

Skunk: (angrily) Oh, I'm a jerk! (enlarges and picks Rigby up in the air) (yelling in a monstrous voice) Raaaaarr! You don't know what I am! Let's see how you like when you can't turn it off!

Mordecai: Let him go! (appears with a shovel) Let him go or I'm gonna make you wish you were road kill. (Skunk drops Rigby) Now get lost!

Skunk: (shrinks) You two are disgusting. I'm outta here! (walks off)

Rigby: Wait, at least tell me how to get this smell off!

Skunk: (yelling) Yeah, right! Figure it out for yourself! (walks through a hole in a fence)

Rigby: What?! Aaaagh! What am I gonna do now?

Mordecai: I don't know dude, but we gotta get that smell off you. It reeks.

(angered, Rigby's eyes grow, his body swells and grows furry, he picks up Mordecai by the neck, choking him)

Rigby: (growling; in a monstrous voice) Don't tell me about how I smell! I know it reeks! You don't think I know it reeks?!

(Mordecai chokes before Rigby lets Mordecai go. As Mordecai catches his breath, Rigby turns back to normal)

Rigby: (back to normal; gasps) What was that?! What did that thing do to me?!

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta find Skips.

(They find Skips outside his house.)

Skips: That was a Were-Skunk.

Rigby: What?

Skips: Yeah. And if you don't get that smell off, you'll turn into one too, you know.

Rigby: What?! What do I do?!

Skips: This is bad. This isn't regular skunk spray. You could try taking a shower. Or if that doesn't work, coffee will dehydrate you and draw some of the smell out, maybe.

Rigby: Seriously, a shower? Coffee? Come on!

(enlarges into a furious monster)

Rigby: (monstrous voice) You think you're so smart, don't you?! "Oh look at me, I'm Skips, I know everything because I'm so old, let me tell you how to fix your problems in a really lame way!" Well, you know what I think? (growls and grabs Skips) You don't know nothin'! You don't know nothin'! (Throws Skips down and shrinks back to normal size.)

Rigby: (back to normal; gasps) Dude, that wasn't me! Skips, I'm sorry!

Skips: (coughs) Forget it, it's fine. But you better get changed back soon. Because once the transformation is complete, you won't wanna change back.

(The duo go to the house)

Benson: What are you doing here? There's no way you got a bingo that fast. (sniffs and coughs) Ugh! What happened?!

Mordecai: Rigby got sprayed by a were-skunk.

Benson: A what?! Ugh!

Rigby: Look, we don't have time. We have to get him cleaned up.

Benson: Ugh! Fine! But don't think this counts as an excuse to get out of your work. You still have to fill out that bingo card. Ugh! (runs into the house while coughing)

(Mordecai is outside the bathroom while Rigby takes a shower)

Mordecai: Dude, I looked all over the internet. We should probably try Skips' coffee idea if the shower doesn't work.

(The shower turns off.)

Mordecai: Dude, did it work? Come on, come out!

(The door opens and it clearly did not work)

Mordecai: Ugh!

Rigby: I used everything, man -- the shampoo, the conditioner, the cologne, and the deodorant.

Mordecai: Man, I thought for sure the shampoo would work. Did you lather, rinse, and repeat?

Rigby: Yeah, I lathered, rinsed, and repeated! I used the whole bottle! (in his monstrous voice) What, you think I don't know how to wash my own hair?! Aah!

(Rigby transforms again, throws Mordecai off the hallway wall, and shrinks back to normal size again.)

Rigby: Mordecai, I'm sorry!

Mordecai: (groans) Just try and take it easy, okay?

Rigby: I'm sorry.

Mordecai: Look, we should go to the coffee shop.

(At the coffee shop, a customer runs outside and gasps from the smell.)

Mordecai: Just relax. I'm gonna go get you a coffee, okay? Relax.

(Rigby puts his face on the desk and whimpers as Mordecai goes to talk to Margaret and Eileen .)

Mordecai: Hey guys — heh, uh gals. Heh. Um, I need a coffee for Rigby — quick.

Margaret: What's wrong?

Mordecai: He got sprayed by a were-skunk.

Eileen: Oh, no!

Margaret: What are you guys doing here, then?

Mordecai: We heard coffee might cure him, but I don't know.

Eileen: Oh no, poor guy. I'm gonna go take him a coffee.

(The three take a coffee to the table.)

Eileen: Hey, Rigby.

Rigby: It's about time. (He slurps the cup of coffee)

Mordecai: Well? Did it work?

(Rigby sniffs himself and whimpers again.)

Eileen: Maybe you have to pour it on yourself?

Rigby: (scoffs) Fine.

(Rigby pours the hot coffee on himself and screams in pain, flying off his stool and onto the floor.)

Mordecai: Did it work?

Rigby: Argh! No! It was just really hot!

(Eileen giggles)

Rigby: You think this is funny?!

(Rigby transforms and lifts Eileen into the air.)

Rigby: (monstrous voice) Well, I don't think it's funny! This is my life you're laughing at!!

Mordecai: Rigby, stop! Stop!

(Rigby sees an angry, shocked crowd of customers, and a scared Eileen)

Eileen: Rigby, you're scaring me!

(Rigby looks full of regret, puts down Eileen, and turns back to normal)

Rigby: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... (runs out of the store in embarrassment)

Mordecai: Rigby, wait!

(Rigby shoves his way through a crowd of pedestrians, grabs the cart, and drives off into the park hills, finding the Were-Skunk's home.)

Rigby: Where are you at, skunk?!

(Rigby pounds the door)

Rigby: Skunk, come out! I know you're in there!

(The door opens and the skunk comes outside.)

Skunk: What?! Oh. It's you. What are you doing here?

Rigby: You have to tell me how to get rid of this.

Skunk: Why would I do that? I'm a huge jerk, remember?

Rigby: I'm sorry. You're not a jerk. Please just tell me how to stop this.

Skunk: Heh. Thing is, I'm sick of being the only skunk in town. Always getting dirty looks, people yelling at you, people hating you 100% of the time. Nah, with you as a skunk, things won't be so bad. All that negative attention won't fall just on me. It'll fall on you, too. We'll split it, fifty-fifty... partner.

Rigby: Noooooooo!

(Rigby transforms and dives for the Were-Skunk, knocking him onto his back into the house.)

Rigby: (punching the skunk) (monstrous voice) Tell me! Tell me how to end this! TELL ME!!

Skunk: (laughing) It's Pineapple Juice, but it's too late anyway. The transformation's already started, partner.

(Rigby runs for the cart and drives back down the hill. However, his hands turn black and like a skunk, causing the cart to melt beneath him. He sprouts a tuft of white hair on his forehead like that of a skunk. He continues to morph into a skunk as he runs home, the path melting behind him. He makes it to the house and dives through the closed front door.)

Benson: What the heck?

(Rigby jumps at Benson, knocking him to the ground, and continues to the kitchen, opening cabinets)

Rigby: There's the Pineapple Juice!

(Rigby struggles to find a can opener in the drawer)

Rigby: Come on, come on! (finally finds one) Yeah! (opens the can and pours it on himself; however, no effect is occurring) Ahh... it's not working!

(The skunk is in the kitchen, laughing evilly)

Skunk: Come on, you didn't think I'd tell you what the real cure was, did you? It's not Pineapple Juice. I was just stalling you so you'd run out of time. Don't worry. Once you're like me, you'll never wanna switch back.

(Rigby's transformation continues, and he screams out "Nooooooooooooo!" in anguish, as the skunk laughs.)

Skunk: Huh?

(Through the window, Mordecai is driving towards the house in a golf cart.)

Mordecai: Rigby! Rigby!

(He tries to get inside but the skunk locks the back door)

Mordecai: Dude, open the door!

Skunk: It's too late - he's my friend now!

Mordecai: Rigby, I've figured it out! It's Tomato Paste! The cure is Tomato Paste!

(Rigby dives for the cabinet and grabs the paste. A long and brutal fight breaks out as the skunk tries to prevent Rigby from opening the can. The skunk sprays Rigby dozens of times and looks to have won the battle)

Skunk: Don't worry, it's almost over, and then you and I will split the skunkin' duties at this park for the rest of eternity!

(Tire-screeching is heard, and a light appears)

Skunk: Huh? (gasps)

(Mordecai crashes through the wall on the golf cart, sending the skunk flying to the ground. The cart hits the wall, and Mordecai is trapped under it, coughing and groaning. The skunk approaches)

Skunk: You think you can stop me from splitting my pain with your friend? You can't stop it. You can't stop nothin'.

Mordecai: You're right, I can't stop it. But Rigby can.

(Mordecai throws the tomato paste to Rigby, who is holding a sledgehammer. Rigby stops the can with his foot, and the camera pans up Rigby's body, to reveal that his Were-Skunk transformation is almost complete.)

Rigby: (monstrous voice) Split this...

(Rigby smashes the can with the hammer and tomato paste flies across the room. Rigby turns back to normal.)

Mordecai: Ha ha ha, we did it! Yeah!

Rigby: Yeah, we did it, yeah!

(A human in a t-shirt and shorts is lying on the floor. He coughs)

Ex-Skunk Human: Thank... you! (makes a very weak grunt and passes out)

Mordecai: He still counts as a skunk, right?

Rigby: Totally counts as a skunk.

(Mordecai marks the skunk box on the bingo card.)

Mordecai: Bingo!

Mordecai and Rigby: Bing-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

(Mordecai throws away the bingo list. The two high five.)

Mordecai: Hunh! Ha ha ha! Yeah!

Mordecai: [gets out of bed] Dude wake up, come on. [yawns] It's time for work.

Rigby: [flailing] Eh-eh-eh-eh! Lame! Dude, come on, let's go watch that karaoke tape from last night.

Mordecai: What tape?

Rigby: Dude, the tape from last night, remember? That old dude with the ponytail gave us a copy of our killer performance. [he says those last two words with flair]

Mordecai: Oh, yeah. Dude, we were awesome last night.

Rigby: Totally awesome!

Mordecai: Where'd you put it?

Rigby: Put what?

Mordecai: The tape.

Rigby: Oh, yeah. I put in the fridge.

Mordecai: Oh, yeah.

Mordecai and Rigby: To keep the tape as cool as were last night. Whhhhhooooooooa! [both spin out the door]

[Cuts to inside of the fridge. Fridge door opens and tape is visible]

Mordecai: So cool.

Mordecai and Rigby: Hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm, hm.

[Mordecai takes tape and closes fridge door. Mordecai plays the tape]

Carrey O 'Key: (on tape) Give it up for Rigby and Mordecai!

[Mordecai and Rigby enter stage on the screen laughing]

Mordecai: (on tape) Dude! [pushes Rigby and picks up microphone] Hurry up, hurry up!

Rigby: (on tape) Alright. Hello, hello, hello!

Mordecai: (on tape) [taps Rigby] Dude, come on.

Rigby: (on tape) This is for all you hard workers out there that get treated like dirt!

Mordecai: Dude, so awesome!

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) We got the right to choose it. There ain't no way to loose it. This is our life, this is our song. (laughs) Oh, we're not gonna take it. No, we ain't gonna take it. We're not gonna take it, anymore.

Rigby: Hey, we're pretty good!

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) [dancing] Woo!

Man: (on tape) What aren't you gonna take?

Mordecai: (on tape) We're not gonna take anymore garbage from our boss Benson. What a loser.

Rigby: (on tape) Yeah, go back to your sad apartment, and be alone forever!

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) Ohhhhhhhh!

Man: (on tape) What else, what else?

Rigby: (on tape) Yeah, and this know-it-all guy Skips, forget him.

Mordecai: (on tape) Yeah, if you're so smart, then why are you stuck working as a groundskeeper?

[Rigby laughs]

Mordecai: (on tape) I'm just saying, I'm just saying.

[Pan to Mordecai and Rigby with horrified faces]

Rigby: (on tape) Oh, dude, and Pops, Pops!

Mordecai: (on tape) Oh, yeah, and this guy Pops just says the dumbest things all the time. You're not as interesting as you think, Pops.

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) Ohhhhhhhhhh! [laughs] We're not gonna take it. No we ain't gonna take it!

[Pan back to Mordecai and Rigby still with horrified faces. Mordecai fast forwards the tape]

Rigby: (on tape) Go chew on your own gumballs, Benson.

[Mordecai laughs]

[Mordecai fast forwards the tape again]

Mordecai: (on tape, imitating Pops) Oh, I'm so old timey, I don't know what anything is.

Mordecai: What the heck are we doing?!

[Mordecai fast forwards the tape again]

Mordecai: (on tape, imitating Skips with a beefy voice) My name's Skips. Let me and my muscles stare at you condescendingly.

Rigby: (on tape) Walking? No, thanks. I'm too good for that.

[Mordecai fast forwards the tape again]

Mordecai: Do you remember any of this?

Rigby: No, no!

[Mordecai fast forwards the tape again. Rigby and Mordecai are laughing on the tape. Mordecai fast forwards the tape again. Rigby and Mordecai are laughing on the tape again. Mordecai fast forwards the tape again]

Rigby: Wait, stop, stop!

Carrey O 'Key: (on tape) What do you think, folks? Do you like these guys?

[Crowd on tape cheers]

Carrey O 'Key: (on tape) Hey, you boys don't mind if I play this video at my club as a promo, do you?

Mordecai: (on tape) Nah, whatever, dude.

Rigby: (on tape) You gotta give us a copy though, so we can re-live this night forever!

[Crowd on tape cheers wildly. Tape ends]

Mordecai: Dude, we can't let anybody see this.

[Door slams.]

Benson: (Off-screen) See what?

[Benson, Pops, Skips, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost enter]

Mordecai: Uh.

Rigby: See this! Bam! [breaks tape in half]

Muscle Man: Pfft, I've seen that before. You're not the only one scared of technology.

Benson: What's this? [walks towards tape case] Carrey O' Key's Karaoke?

Pops: (gleefully) Did you say karaoke? Oh, I just love karaoke! Oh, we must go Benson, we must!

Skips: Yeah, that would be pretty fun!

Benson: Alright.

Mordecai and Rigby: (disbelievingly) What!?

Benson: Well I have been working you all pretty hard lately, so how 'bout we all go out tonight and karaoke it up, my treat?

(Pops, Muscle Man, Skips and Hi Five Ghost cheer)

Benson: Great idea, guys. Alright, let's finish our work for the day, fellas.

Muscle Man: This is gonna be awesome!

Pops: Ooh, I can feel the excitement in my bladder!

Rigby: Man, we're totally dead.

Mordecai: Dead? Dude, they're gonna hate us forever! [facepalms] Awww, why are we so dumb?

Rigby: It was the music, man! It fueled our frustrations, it wasn't our fault!

Mordecai: Whatever, we just can't let them see us trashing them. We gotta go find that master tape.

Rigby: But how are we gonna do that?

Mordecai: Dude, it'll be easy. We'll just go ask that fat dude for the tape, and if he says no, we'll just take it from him.

[But then the bodyguard Carl grabbed Mordecai and Rigby and threw them out the door at Carrey O' Key's]

Carrey O' Key: I said "no"! I can play that tape whenever I feel like it, and there's not a darn thing you can do about it. I don't wanna see you punks back here again. You're banned! [slams door]

[Scene cuts to the snack bar. Mordecai and Rigby walk up to Benson]

Mordecai: Benson! Hey, man, we need to talk to you about tonight.

Benson: I'm only paying for the songs. You're on your own for food and drinks. [walks away]

Muscle Man: Aww, what? Well, I've always got my gravy pouch. [pulls up shirt to reveal gravy pouch. Sucks gravy from a tube] Ahhh.

Mordecai: No, Benson, wait! We don't think going to karaoke tonight is such a good idea.

Benson: What?

Rigby: Karaoke's lame. We should do something really fun, like bowling!

Mordecai: Yeah, bowling's good! Or pool, the pool hall's always fun. Rap 'em up!

Benson: Guys, please.

Rigby: If we're throwing out halls, why not the greatest hall of them all?

Mordecai: Dance hall.

Rigby: Bingo!

Mordecai: (taking Rigby literally) Oh, bingo? Really?

Benson: Guys.

Rigby: No no no, dance hall, I was saying bingo like "You got it!". Bingo halls are for losers.

Benson: Guys! What is it with you two? I'm trying to do something nice for everyone, boost morale around here. Besides, I've already called the karaoke place and reserved a table.

Mordecai: But wait, can't we just-

Benson: No, we're going to karaoke, and you know what, now it's mandatory. Yup, mandatory having fun at karaoke night. You don't come and you're fired. [runs off] So deal with it!!!

Mordecai: Now what?

[Cut to Carrey O' Key's]

Pops: Ooh, look how many songs. I'm gonna sing them all!

Benson: No, Pops, just one. (smiling) Skips, what're you gonna sing?

Skips: Do they have anything with Spanish guitar?

Muscle Man: [fist pumping] Woo! Skips bringing it old school! Woo!

Benson: Ugh. Where's Mordecai and Rigby?

Waiter: Uh, ready to order sir?

Benson: No, we're still waiting for two. They don't think I was serious about this being mandatory. I was being serious. If they don't show up they're fired!

Pops: Ooh, they'll be here!

[Pans to vents above where Mordecai and Rigby are]

Rigby: Oh, man. Dude, we gotta hurry this up, Benson's gonna blow a fuse!

Mordecai: Rigby! [crawls towards a vent grate] Hey, I found it.

[Scene pans down the grate to a office]

Carrey O' Key: Hey Carl, how many people signed up for karaoke so far?

Carl: Just one, boss.

Carrey O' Key: Well, dang it, that's not enough! We can't keep this place going with just one singer a night! It's time to play that dang tape! If that won't get people singing, nothing will. Now get me ready like we talked about, you know how I got stagefright.

[Carl slaps Carrey several times. Carrey owner runs onto stage]

Carrey O' Key: [laughing] Yes! Welcome, folks! Now I know some of you first timers might be a little shy but sure of your talent's with us, so we put together this little promo video to put all your fears to rest. Here we go. [plays video]

Carrey O' Key: (on tape) Scared to get up on stage to sing? Don't be! You couldn't be worse than these guys.

[Video shows Mordecai and Rigby singing and dancing]

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) We're not gonna take it. No, we ain't gonna take it.

Benson: Oh, my.

Pops: It's Moredcai and Rigby!

[Skips, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost murmur excitedly. Cut to Mordecai and Rigby hanging from the vent in the office']

Mordecai: [sees the video playing on the computer screen] Aw, dude, they're playing the promo! C'mon! [falls to ground] Ugh.

[Rigby lets go of the vent]

Mordecai: Wait-

[Rigby falls onto Mordecai]

Mordecai: Ugh.

[Pan back to the video, Mordecai and Rigby are still dancing and singing]

Mordecai and Rigby: (on tape) We're not gonna take it, anymore!

[Benson, Pops, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost and Skips laugh]

Benson: So this is why they didn't want us to come tonight! They must've been super embarrassed by their singing.

Mordecai: (on tape) We're not gonna take anymore garbage from our boss, Benson!

Benson: What the?

Mordecai: (on tape) What a los...!

[Video cuts off. Carrey owner gasps and presses remote before running back on stage]

Carrey O' Key: Well, uh, sorry folks, um, technical difficulties. Aw, oh hey, why don't we start the songs, shall we? Uh first up we have Pops!

[Pops runs on stage]

Pops: That's me! [giggles] I've been working so hard I'm punching my card.

[Carrey owner runs into the office]

Pops: (voice over) Eight hours for what?

Carrey O' Key: Hey!

Mordecai: [gasps] Get the tape! Get the tape!

Carrey O' Key: Carl!

Pops: (voice over) I've got this feeling that times been holding me down.

Mordecai: Dude, what's going on?!

Rigby: I don't know, it's stuck!

[Carl runs into the office]

Rigby: Come on, come on!

['Mordecai and Carl fight]

Pops: (voice over) I'll hit the ceiling. Or else I'll tear up this town

[Rigby gets the tape but is knocked out by Carl. Mordecai tackles Carl. Carrey owner restrains Mordecai as Rigby punches the tape out of Carl's hand. The tape flies out the door]

Pops: (voice over) Tonight, I gotta cut loose. Footloose.
[Mordecai elbows Carrey owner and the four all chase after the tape]

Pops: (voice over) Kick off your sunday shoes.

[Mordecai gets the tape to be tackled by Carl.]

Pops: (voice over) Please, Louise. Pull off of my knees.

[Mordecai and Carl roll in front of the stage. Skips picks up the tape]

Pops: (voice over) Jack, get back. Come on before we crack.

[Carl punches Skips in the face and gets the tape. Skips runs after Carl and punches him]

Pops: (voice over) Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose!

[A riot breaks out in the restaurant. Muscle Man tears off his shirt and drinks from the gravy pouch]

Pops: (voice over) You're playing so cool.

[Muscle Man tackles a man running buy]

Pops: (voice over) Obeying every rule.

[Rigby runs by with the tape with Carrey chasing him)

Pops: (voice over) I dig a way down in your heart. You're burning yearning for songs. Somebody to tell you.

[People's hands grabbing for the tape]

Pops: (voice over) That life ain't passing you by. I'm trying to tell you that life ain't passing you by. I'm trying to tell you it will if you don't even try.
[Small montage of Mordecai, Rigby, Carl, and Carrey fighting for the tape]

Pops: (voice over) [punches man charging at him] You can fly if you only cut loose.
[Hi Five Ghost punches a man in the face.]

Pops: (voice over) Foot loose. Kick off your Sunday shoes.

[Muscle Man's gravy pouch bursts. He screeches and chases the man that punched it]

Pops: (voice over) Oowhee, Marie, shake it, shake it for me.

[Carl, Mordecai and Rigby fight for the tape. It flies and lands at Benson's feet. Benson picks it up]

Pops: (voice over) Whoa, Milo, c'mon, c'mon let's go.

[Carrey punches Benson in the face]

Carrey O' Key's: GIMME ThAT TAPE!!!!

Pops: (voice over) Lose, your blues.

Benson: You want it? Fine! Take it, then! [throws tape at the Carrey O' Key's owner, the tape breaks into pieces]

Pops: (Voice over) Everybody cut footloose! Ohhh! Cut footloose! (Spoken)Thank you.

[Police siren sounds. Cut to outside of Carrey O' Key's, several police cars and ambulances are parked]

Mordecai: Sorry, guys.

Rigby: Yeah, sorry.

Mordecai: We didn't mean to ruin your good time.

Benson: No no, I don't want to hear it! I don't know what was on that tape, or why those guys were after it, but I'm gonna get to the bottom of this. (turns pink) YOU'VE RUINED KARAOKE NIGHT!!!! [does a doughnut with the golf cart and drives away with Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, Pops and Skips]

Mordecai: Yeah uh, I know, that's why we were trying to apologize to you. Man, karaoke sucks.

Rigby: Alright, Beef Burrito. I'm gonna give you one more chance to take back what you said about my mom! (A Beef Burrito doll lies silently on the floor) I'll kill you!

(He pats his elbow and jumps onto a trampoline, body-slamming the doll. He then elbows the doll multiple times, and body slams it once more. He picks up the doll and moves its arm, making it punch himself in the face. Behind him, Mordecai is calling to him)

Mordecai: Tag up! Tag up!

(Pretending to be weakened, Rigby walks over to Mordecai and high-fives him. As Rigby drinks a soda, Mordecai pulls the Beef Burrito doll away. Rigby slams the soda can onto the ground and lets out a ferocious cry. Mordecai sets the doll up next to a bed before walking away onto the shelves.)

Rigby: What? (silence) Oh, you want us to put the hurt on you? (Mordecai grabs Rigby) I think he wants me to put the hurt on him.

Mordecai: I think he wants you to put the hurt on him.

Rigby: You think he wants me to put the hurt on him?

Mordecai: Yes, I do!

(Mordecai & Rigby scream. Mordecai throws Rigby down onto the trampoline, launching him into the wall. The impact leaves a large hole in the wall and Rigby ends up in a trash can.)

Rigby: Uhhh..... (Stands up) Uuuuhhhhyyyy.... (Removes trash can) Yea-uh!! Did you see how awesome it was when I hit the trampoline?

Mordecai: Hahahaha! Yeah, I did. But it wasn't as awesome as when you punched that hole in the wall.

(They begin laughing, but suddenly stop as the realization hits them, which causes them to scream in horror. Rigby quickly opens the door and checks to see if anyone is in the hallway, then shuts the door.)

Mordecai: I can't believe I listened to you! I knew I should've gone out to do some work, but no, "Let's wrestle this stupid doll, it'll be fun!".

Rigby: But it WAS fun!

Mordecai: Well, yeah. But now there's a big hole in the wall! Dude, we're 23 years old, we shouldn't be busting holes in walls. We're gonna get fired for this!

Rigby: You mean, you're gonna get fired for this.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: You're the one who threw me too hard, ya hole!

Mordecai: Don't call me a hole! You're the hole, you're the one who wanted to wrestle!

Rigby: Okay, okaaayy! Let's not blame anyone! Now, how in the "h" are we gonna fix this "s"? (In reruns, the line is changed to "Now, how in the heck are we gonna fix this stuff?" In the UK, the line is changed to "Now, how in the heck are we gonna fix this hole?")

Mordecai: I don't know man. I mean, we can't fix it, and we definitely can't pay for it, 'cause we don't have any money! Unless you have some money.

Rigby: No. Besides, I don't even know how much it costs to fix a hole like this. Probably a ton.

Mordecai: Exactly. Which leaves us with only one possible solution: We convince Benson to give us raises so we can afford to pay someone else to fix it.

Rigby: Dude...you are a GENIUS! Of COURSE raises!

Mordecai: Okay, dude, here's-

Rigby: Let me stop you there, because I already know what you're going to say...HAAAAMBONING.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Yeah, dude, Hamboning! We just go up to Benson and we'll be all like, "We both want raises!" (Repeatedly taps all over himself while walking towards Mordecai, then starts tapping Mordecai)

Mordecai: No, man! Stop it! We just need to ask him for a raise and just explain all the-

Rigby: No, no, NO, that's not gonna work! What are you, 65? (Imitating an old man) "Excuse me, sir, can I have a raise?" COME ON! I'm telling you, dude. HAAAMBONIIIING.

Mordecai: (Crosses arms) Noooooo.

Rigby: Hamboning will save your LIFE someday. It'll be all like, "What? You're trying to mug me?" (Starts hamboning again)

Mordecai: No! We're not doing that, okay? OKAY?

Rigby: Fine...(Gasps) I know what to do! (Runs to a pile of dirty clothes and gets a red keyboard) Are you ready for raises? Boop-bweeep-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boooo!

Mordecai: (In awe) Whoa-ho-ho-ho, how did you get that?

Rigby: I have my methods.

(Scene cuts to a flashback. A wizard places the same red keyboard on a bench. The wizard then heads towards a bush and urinates on it. Rigby steals the keyboard and runs away. Scene cuts back to Rigby and Mordecai. Rigby laughs to himself.)

Mordecai: I don't know, dude. How's that gonna get us raises?

Rigby: Aw, come on, man! Look! (Sets keyboard on floor) Just come check it out. (Plays keyboard and it makes cool noises)

Mordecai: Woaaaaah-ho-ho-ho-ho! This is the answer to ALL our problems. Have you named her yet?

Rigby: Actually, I thought you could do the honors.

Mordecai: Really?

Rigby: Mmhmm. (Nods)

Mordecai: Ya know, I've always wanted to date a girl named: The Power.

Rigby: The Power?

Mordecai: (Nods) Mmhmm.

Rigby: I like it.

(Suddenly, the words "The Power" appear at the top of the keyboard)

Mordecai & Rigby: Cool...!

(Scene cuts to the park)

Mordecai: Alright, this time with feeling.

Rigby: Yeah yeah. Ready?

Mordecai: Yeah yeah.

Rigby: Ok. (Presses The Power's on button)

Mordecai & Rigby: (They start singing) 5, 6, 7, 8. (They start dancing to The Power's music, spin and then point) Give us a raise, loser. (They laugh)

Rigby: Hey, it's Pops.

Pops: A-ha-ha! Hello.

Mordecai: Hey Pops, what's up?

Pops: Is that the sound of music I hear?

Rigby: (Whispers to Mordecai) Dude, let's use The Power on Pops.

Mordecai: I don't know, Pops is kind of weird. (They look over at Pops)

(Pops laughs strangely as a butterfly approaches his face)

Rigby: Exactly, at least we can test it out on him, and he won't get mad at us if it doesn't work.

Mordecai: Ok, but let's not call him a loser.

Rigby: Why not?

Mordecai: He's sensitive. I don't want him to cry, I just want him to give us a raise.

Rigby: Ok, let's do it. Hey Pops! Check it. (Presses the on button again)

Mordecai & Rigby: 5, 6, 7, 8. Give us a raise, Pops.

Pops: (Laughs) Good show, jolly good show! A pay increase, yes yes of course. Just let me get my billfold. Butterscotch Ripple? (Mordecai and Rigby take one) Ta-ta! (He leaves)

Mordecai: Dude, I think that just worked.

Rigby: Yeah, I know.

Mordecai: I mean, if Pops wasn't so weird, he might have given us actual money.

Rigby: Totally.

(Mordecai and Rigby run off to show Benson The Power. Cut to Benson working at the shed.)

Benson: Ugh...

Mordecai & Rigby: Hey, Benson. Five, six, seven, eight. (They start dancing to The Power's music)

Benson: What are you doing?

Mordecai & Rigby: (They spin and point at Benson) Give us a raise, loser. (They quickly back up, afraid of how Benson will react)

Benson: You know, you guys have been working harder, I think you deserve a raise. We can negotiate your new rates later in the week, but for now, how's 20 bucks sound? (He hands Mordecai and Rigby two 20 dollar bills) Keep up the good work. (Drives away in a cart)

Rigby: Do you realize what this means?

Mordecai: We can fix the hole?

Rigby: No, we can do everything we ever wanted!

(Clock transition to a montage of Mordecai and Rigby using The Power to get a bunch of stuff, then they fly down and bump into Skips)

Skips: You guys shouldn't be doing what you just did.

Rigby: What, the flying or the hole?

Skips: What hole?

Rigby: Dude, get to The Power, he knows.

Skips: Knows what?

Mordecai: Nothing Skips, uh, we were just getting back to work. (To Rigby) Dude, kick it to max power.

(Rigby turns on the keyboard)

Mordecai & Rigby: Five, six, seven, eight! Using the Power in your face. Sending you back to your place. Don't look at our crotches while we synchronize our watches. (They press buttons on each other's watches) Boop-boop-bweep—boop-boop-boo-bweep-bee-boo. Beep-beep-beep, beep-beep-beep, synchronized. (They put on red sweaters) Go away Skips, it's time for you to go away.

Mordecai: It's time for you to go to your room!

Rigby: Yeah, Skips. It's time for you to go to the moon!

(Skips disappears)

Mordecai: (Gasps) Where'd he go?

Rigby: Uh...

Mordecai: Did you just send Skips to the moon?

Rigby: Isn't that what you said?

Mordecai: No, room. I sent him to his room, not the moon, you idiot! Dude, wish him back.

Rigby: But it doesn't work that way.

Mordecai: What do you mean?

Rigby: I can't see him, can I?

Mordecai: Ugh, then we have to go get him.

Rigby: But he's going to be pissed! (In reruns, the line is changed to "But he's going to be ticked.")

Mordecai: Better than him being dead.

Benson: Hey, hey have you two seen Skips?

Mordecai: Rigby sent him to the moon.

(Rigby punches Mordecai, who then punches him. Rigby groans in pain.)

Benson: Wait, what?

Mordecai: We accidentally sent Skips to the moon with this keyboard and now we have to get him back.

(Benson laughs)

Pops: Ooh, I love the moon.

Benson: Come on, where's Skips?

Mordecai: Ugh! Look, we'll show you.

Rigby: Come on, let's go! Jeez, you take forever.

Mordecai: Sorry, Pops had to go to the bathroom.

Pops: Twice.

Benson: So what do we do?

Mordecai: Don't worry, we got it.

Mordecai & Rigby: (They start playing the keyboard and singing) Take us to the moon! Take us to the moon! Woah-oh! Won't you take us to the moon?

(Nothing happens)

Benson: Ha-ha, very fun-

(The cart suddenly vanishes. Cut to everyone in the cart screaming as they're hurled through space. They crash-land on the moon. Everybody is heard coughing and moaning. Benson gets up.)

Benson: What is all this junk?

(An assortment of items are sitting before them.)

Rigby: Um, don't get mad at me guys, but, uh, I kinda sent a bunch of stuff to the moon while you guys were in the house.

(Flashback to Rigby playing with The Power)

Rigby: (Singing) A bunch of baby ducks. Send 'em to the moon. Soda machine that doesn't work. Send 'em to the moon.

(Shifts back to present)

Mordecai: You drillbit. What else did you send?

(Suddenly a Moon Monster appears, who is chasing Skips)

Pops: Look, it's Skips! There he is!

Mordecai: Oh great, it had to be a monster.

Benson: (backing away) What is that?

Mordecai: Rigby, you guys go get Skips. We'll pick you up.

Rigby: Ok, ok. (he and Benson run towards Skips while holding The Power.)

Mordecai: (struggling to turn the cart right side up) Pops, help me with this.

Rigby: Let's go, let's go!

(The Moon Monster, now in possession of Skips, roars. Rigby sets The Power down.)

Benson: Come on!

Rigby: Give me a break, I have to come up with the words you know. (counts on his fingers) Ok, I got it. (He begins playing The Power) G-g-g-go away big monster go-go...(The Power begins to lose power)...no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

Benson: What?

(Rigby tries to play The Power, but it's unresponsive)

Rigby: Dude, I think the batteries just died.

Benson: What?!

(The Moon Monster closes in on Rigby and Benson. Mordecai and Pops have managed to turn the cart upright.)

Mordecai: Hurry up dude!

Rigby: The batteries are dead!

Mordecai: What?!

(flashback: Rigby recalls what he said about hamboning.)

Rigby: Hamboning will save your LIFE someday. It'll be all like, "What? You're trying to mug me?" I'm telling you, dude. HAAAMBONIIIING.

(transition back to the present)

Rigby: I know what to do. Hold this. (He hands The Power to Benson and runs off towards the Moon Monster, who is about to eat Skips) Nooo!

(Rigby begins hamboning the monster, which distracts him. Skips escapes from the Moon Monster's grip, then runs and grabs Rigby just seconds before the Moon Monster tries to crush him with his fist. Skips, holding Rigby, runs up to the cart, which is being driven by Mordecai, along with Pops and Benson.)

Rigby: WHOO! HAAAMBONIIIING.

(Skips and Rigby jump onto the cart.)

Mordecai: I can't believe you just did that.

(the Moon Monster pursues the cart)

Skips: Use your keyboard!

Rigby: The batteries are dead.

(Skips looks back at Monster, who is dangerously close by now)

Skips: (punches through cart and pulls out a batch of power wires, which he plugs into The Power) Play it!

(Rigby quickly starts playing The Power. The Moon Monster reels back for a punch.)

Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Benson, and Pops: TAKE US HOME, TAKE US HOME, TAKE US ALL BACK HOME!

(They disappear mere seconds before the Moon Monster crushes the golf cart to pieces. Everyone screams as they're launched through space. They land in Mordecai and Rigby's room. All of the walls break apart and collapse, save for the hole Rigby and Mordecai made earlier.)

Rigby: Ha ha ha, we did it! Yeah! (triumphantly lifts The Power over his head, which Benson swiftly takes.) Hey, that's mine.

Benson: Nope, you sent him to the moon so the least you can do is give him your keyboard, right Skips?

Skips: Right. (breaks The Power with knee)

Mordecai & Rigby: Awwww.

Benson: And let's have it.

Rigby: What?

Benson: (turning red) THE $40.00 YOU TWO CONNED OUT OF ME WITH THAT STUPID KEYBOARD CRAP! (Clean version is same, but "Crap" is replaced with "Crud")​​​ I know you still got it, now, give it back.

Rigby: (sighs)

(Rigby and Mordecai hand their 20 dollar bills back to Benson.)

Benson: NOW CLEAN UP THIS MESS OR YOU'RE FIRED!!!!!! Ugh, can you believe this?

Skips: No.

(Benson, Pops and Skips leave the room, slamming the door on the way out.)

Rigby: Oh, dude, this sucks. The hole's still there. Do you think Benson noticed it?

Mordecai: (puts poster over hole) He won't now.

Rigby: Dude, you're a genius! (they high-five)

Benson: Alright, listen up. We've got this birthday party today, so... lots to do, lots to do... Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost, you're in charge of picking up the special entertainment.

Muscle Man & Hi Five Ghost: Yes! Uh! (they high-five)

Benson: Skips, you set up the bouncy castle.

Skips: Hmm. (skips over into a bush)

Benson: Let's see, I'm picking up the kids, so... Mordecai and Rigby, you set up the chairs.

Mordecai & Rigby: Augh! (Mordecai slides down the steps, onto the ground. Pops calls from above)

Pops: Oh, what about me~? Surely, I'm invited to my own birthday party!

Benson: Um, your birthday was last week, remember? It's a kid's party today.

Pops: (pulls out a bundle of balloons) I still have balloons!

Benson: We've got it covered, Pops.

Pops: (sadly) Oh. I see. (slips out, and is carried through the air by the balloons)

Mordecai: Dude, how come we always get stuck with the lame jobs? Setting up the chairs?!

Rigby: Lame!!!

Benson: I can't trust you guys with something actually important. You're always slacking off.

Mordecai: You calling us slackers?

Rigby: Did he? Did you?

Mordecai: He's calling us slackers. Look dude, we can totally set up all those chairs without slacking off.

Benson: Good. Do it then.

Mordecai: We will.

Rigby: Yeah, and then next time you'll get someone else to set up the chairs?

(Mordecai does a shrugging motion)

Benson: Fine.

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOOOOOOHHH!!! Not settin' up the chairs next time! Not settin' up the chairs next time! UHHHHH!

Benson: Just set up the chairs.

(Transition to outside of a birthday party circus building. Mordecai and Rigby with the trolley of chairs)

Rigby: Benson's gonna drop his balls when he sees how good we set up these chairs, he's gonna be all like (imitating Benson) "Oh no, my gumballs."

Mordecai: Ha ha ha! Yeah-ya, we rule at settin' up the chairs. (hands Rigby a chair) 1.

Rigby: Yaaa! 1! (throws chair it falls on the ground) Yeah dude, this sucks.

Mordecai: I agree dude, and normally I'd be all "let's quit", but we have to prove to Benson we can set up these chairs.

Rigby: All right. AAGGGHHH! Must be nice to be the boss. Benson never has to do chores.

(Scene is now set to the highway, and Benson is driving a bus full of kids. The kid with the crown and a drink named "Jimmy".)

Benson: Happy birthday Jimm--

Jimmy: Just drive the bus, you crazy slop jockey!

(Scene goes back to Mordecai and Rigby)

(Rigby is wearing a bunch of chairs, imitating a robot wreaking mass destruction.)

Rigby: BEW! BEW! BEW! PSSHHH! BEW! HA HA! (knocks over the chairs)

Mordecai: What the H, dude?

Rigby: Hahahahahahahaha!

Mordecai: Can we please just focus?

Rigby: AGGHHH! (takes off chair) When you say that, it makes me tired. (sits)

Mordecai: Dude!

Rigby: Agghh! You sound like Benson.

Mordecai: Dude, listen. If we pound through this, we'll never have to do this lame chair stuff again.

Rigby: (gasp) Next time it could be us picking up...

Mordecai & Rigby: The special entertainment!

(Scene goes to where the special entertainment gets picked up by Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost)

(Muscle Man knocks on the door.)

(Door opens showing eyeballs)

Muscle Man: We are here to pick you up.

(Door opens showing a horse)

Special Entertainment Horse: Just a second.

Special Entertainment Clown: Aghhyyyagghh... who's at the door? Whoa, it's bright! (Puts on sunglasses)

Muscle Man: You know who likes special entertainment like that? My mom!

Special Entertainment Clown: Could I borrow five bucks?

(Scene goes back to Mordecai and Rigby)

Mordecai: 37... (Rigby throws chair, Mordecai holds it, and puts it down) 38...38...Rigby!

(cut to Rigby lying on the trolley with no more chairs)

Rigby: That's all the chairs, dude.

Mordecai: There's supposed to be 50.

Rigby: That's Benson's problem.

Mordecai: No dude, that's our problem.

Rigby: HMM!

Mordecai: C'mon, we've gotta find the rest.

Rigby: Fine! (gets up and runs to the side of the structure, getting ahead of Mordecai) Let's find your stupid chairs. (Rigby approaches a door, and pushes it effortlessly, likely as an attempt to ditch the job.) It won't open, let's get out of here.

Mordecai: Did you try the actual door knob?

Rigby: Aagghh, you're killing me... (slides his hand over the door knob, again, effortlessly.) It's locked, let's do something else.

Mordecai: C'mon dude, take this seriously. (grabs the door knob and turns it both ways, but turns out Rigby's moaning about it being locked was spot on.) Oh, it is locked.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm.

Mordecai: We've gotta get those chairs. (Mordecai runs at the door)

Rigby: HEY! (Mordecai slams into the door, knocking it down)

Mordecai: AAAGGGHHHH!! (he's on the floor rubbing his arm in pain)

Rigby: Whoa!

Mordecai: Agh, you see the chairs?

Rigby: Even better...

Mordecai: What do you mea-- (gasp) (The two see arcade games all set up in a line.)

Rigby: It's like old school heaven!

Mordecai: Yeah, look at these things! Ball of Yarn, Lemonade Stand, Hats 4 Sale, Clap Like This, Candle Maker, Deli Dude, Staring Contest?!?! Why are these even here?!

Rigby: Who cares? Let's play! (Mordecai grabs his head)

Mordecai: No dude. Dude, no. You want Benson to think we're slackers forever?

Rigby: I don't know. Do you want to be boring forever?

Mordecai: Not cool dude.

Rigby: Whatever, I'm taking my break. (Rigby starts game and idiotically smashes his fist against the buttons.)

Mordecai: Dude, you're not even doing it right. You're just mashing the buttons.

Rigby: Whatever, why don't you go back to work?

Mordecai: I know, how 'bout I take my break too? (Mordecai knocks Rigby out of the way and plays the game without the button mashing) Bam! (Game screen displays "You win") OHHHH!!!

Rigby: Man, that was just luck.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. (Mordecai starts the game again. A montage begins of Mordecai and Rigby playing each game, and Mordecai winning every time while Rigby mashes the buttons. All the while with Mordecai yelling "OHHH!" with every win. And for the climax...) OHHHH!!! TEN IN A ROOOOWWWW!!!!!! Alright, let's finish those chairs.

Rigby: Wait man, what about that one? (Rigby sees another game in the back, which has a note "Out of order" and is covered by a sheet)

Mordecai: Didn't they teach you how to read? "Out of order".

(Rigby gives him a look and takes the sheet off. Revealing a game called "Destroyer of Worlds")

Rigby: Whoa! This... looks... awesome!

Mordecai: Yeah, whatever, it's broken.

Rigby: Probably because people couldn't stop playing it, cause it's so awesome!

(Rigby bangs at the bottom of the stand in a pitiful attempt to fix the game)

Mordecai: How are you gonna fix that with your third grade education?

Rigby: Hey! Why don't you go ask Benson to tell you what to do?

Mordecai: Move over, Rigby.

(They open the control panel, and when they do, they find a note attached to one of the wires.)

Mordecai & Rigby: (reading) "In the name of all that is holy, don't connect the red wire to the blue wire"?

Mordecai: I don't think we should do this.

(Rigby takes the note, throws it behind him, and tries to connect the two wires to get the game to work, all the while with sparks flying every time.)

Rigby: C'mon c'mon!

(Rigby successfully connects the wires and a smoky face of Destroyer of Worlds appears)

Destroyer of Worlds (smoke version): Ha, ha, ha ha!

(The power goes out)

Mordecai: Dude, what just happened?

Rigby: I don't know.

(Game turns on, but with the power in the building still off. The game's turning on force sends Mordecai and Rigby flying and when they look back at it, the Destroyer of Worlds spawns)

Mordecai: That can't be good.

Rigby: I don't know, it could be cool.

(DOW blasts a hole through the wall)

Mordecai: Oh man, we're so dead.

Rigby: Maybe no one will notice.

(DOW shoots lasers and sets the trees on fire)

Pops: Oh, who unleashed the Destroyer of Worlds? Good show!

Mordecai: We better go find Skips.

(Mordecai and Rigby run to Skips, who is currently setting up the bouncy castle.)

Mordecai & Rigby: (panting)

Mordecai: Skips, uh dude.

Skips: What did you guys do?

Mordecai: What? Nothing. Heh.

(DOW still shooting lasers, destroys the playground's slide.)

Destroyer of Worlds: Ha, ha, ha, ha!

Skips: You ignored my note, didn't you?

Mordecai: A note? What note?

Rigby: You mean like a musical note?

(DOW shoots his laser again, this time setting the bouncy castle on fire.)

Skips: You fools! Destroyer of Worlds will kill us all!

(Destroyer of Worlds appears behind them and laughs evilly)

Skips: I have an idea, but I need time. Distract it!

Mordecai: Wait, what? Distract it how?

Rigby (picks up a rock): Get outta here! (throws the rock at DOW, which in turn hits the floating face. The response is a frown, signalling more attacks coming their way.) Uh-oh.

Mordecai & Rigby (while getting chased by the DOW): AAAHHHHHH!!!!

(Benson pulls up with the bus)

Benson: We're here... AAAAHHHHHH!!!!

(DOW goes up to the bus)

Kids on the bus: It's the special entertainment! Yay!

(DOW blasts through the top of the bus, opening up the roof. In response, Benson and the kids on board scream. The kids run off of the bus and then run into Muscle Man and High Five Ghost, who are arriving with the real special entertainment.)

Muscle Man: Hey kids. Get ready for our very special entertainment!

(Right as they begin to perform their act, with the horse waving, Destroyer of Worlds fires his laser at the two, disintegrating them into ashes. The kids scream again and scatter around the park, Destroyer of Worlds setting more of the park on fire.)

Mordecai: We're screwed.

(Skips arrives back in the cart with a set of Arcade stands)

Skips: Get in!

(Mordecai and Rigby run to the cart and it takes off in pursuing the Destroyer of Worlds.)

Skips: Climb on top but don't press start until I say.

(Mordecai and Rigby climb onto the top of the golf cart and Pops crashes into the golf cart)

Pops: Skips my good man! I lost my balloons.

Skips: Take the wheel.

(Skips leaves the cart and Pops starts the driving in chasing the Destroyer of Worlds)

Pops: It must be my birthday!

Skips: Okay everyone, press your start buttons on three. One, two, three!

(Everyone presses start, which in turn creates a huge video game character much bigger than the floating face in Destroyer of Worlds.)

Mordecai and Rigby: Whoa!

(Destroyer of Worlds fires his laser at the character.)

Skips: Mordecai and I got the arms, Rigby, you got the legs.

Rigby: (mashing the buttons) Aw what, legs?! Legs suck man, this is worse than the chairs!

(The video game man is spinning round in circles firing pixelated burgers all over the place, not at Destroyer of Worlds)

Mordecai: Dude, quit mashing the buttons, you're messing up the legs!

Rigby: SHUT UP!!!

(After a moment of jumping about, the character runs away, with Destroyer of Worlds giving chase.)

Skips: Drive, Pops, drive!

Pops: This is so much fun! Woohoo!

(Pops hits the pedal on the cart and chases after the two battling characters. As they get ahead of Destroyer of Worlds and drive in front of hit, the mask fires a laser at the cart, knocking off Skips in the process.)

Mordecai: Skips! Pops stop, we lost Skips!

(Pops skids the cart to a halt.)

Mordecai: Skips! (Destroyer of Worlds destroys an other building, Mordecai gasps in turn seeing the extra chairs) The extra chairs! Dude, you kill the Destroyer of Worlds, I'm gonna go get the chairs!

(Mordecai jumps off the top of the cart)

Rigby: It's too dangerous, just leave them!

Mordecai: I don't care, we're not slackers!

(Destroyer of Worlds follows Mordecai to the building, firing at him.)

Rigby: (gasps, believing that Mordecai was shot) MORDECAI!

(Mordecai is inside the building holding onto one of the chairs, taking cover from the Destroyer of World's lasers)

Mordecai: AAAHHH!

(Rigby starts mashing all of the buttons on every arcade stand. Which begins to work as the Destroyer of Worlds is taking damage from the pixelated burgers)

Destroyer Of Worlds: WHAT THE...

Mordecai: The button mashing's working! Finish him off dude!

Rigby: AAAAHHHH!

(Rigby mashes every button and his tail grabbing the analogue stick Skips was on. The video game character finishes off the Destroyer of Worlds, once defeated, it turns into a cherry. The character walks up to it and eats it with 100 points popping up.)

Mordecai: That was some pretty sweet button mashing. (he and Rigby hi five)

Rigby: I told you I got skills.

(Benson climbs out of a fiery ditch, red in the face)

Benson: YOU!!!!!!

Mordecai: Whoa, hey, Benson. Before you freak out, we totally set up those chairs.

(Revealing the kids sitting on the chairs, surrounded by fire. Muscle Man and High Five Ghost also joining in on the fun)

Muscle Man: Whoo! This birthday party's hot!

Rigby: So we're cool, right?

Benson: YOU IDIOTS!!! That's the last time I entrust you with something important, LIKE THE CHAIRS!!!!!!!!!!!!

Mordecai & Rigby: OOOOHHHH!!! Not setting up the chairs next time! Not setting up the chairs next time!

Benson: But you are gonna clean up this mess, and you can start by sweeping up the special entertainment.

(Benson walks away)

Mordecai: Yeah, no problem.

Rigby: We got it.

Mordecai: Don't worry about us.

Rigby: We're gonna take a break first, right?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Rigby: Yes! Fist Pump!

(Mordecai and Rigby do fist pumps)

Mordecai & Rigby: Heh heh heh heh. Yeah, yeah! (Continue fist pumping until the music ends). Heh heh heh heh heh!

Announcer: (Spoken very fast) Listen up, pump heads, Fist Pump is coming to Slammers! They just got out of jail, and rehab, and now they're back, and ready to rock your 11-through-15-year-old pants off! That's our demographic: get over it. That's right! Fist Pump live!

Other Announcer: Live!

Announcer: At Slammers this Friday!

Other Announcer: Friday!

Announcer: Be there or be a loser!

Mordecai: Ha ha ha, there's gonna be so many losers at that concert.

Rigby: We have to go to that concert.

Mordecai: Seriously? Dude, they were cool in the 3rd grade. But now-

Rigby: Correction, they're cool in any grade, but you wouldn't know that. Probably because you hate yourself or something.

Mordecai: Dude, we don't have the money for those tickets.

Rigby: Doesn't even matter. We can figure out a way, but you're too busy figuring out a way to hate yourself.

Mordecai: Why do you wanna go so bad?

Rigby: Going to this concert could be the biggest moment of my life.

Mordecai: Wow, sounds like your life sucks.

Rigby: SHUT UP!

Mordecai: Heh-heh-heh-heh.

Margaret: Hey, guys.

Mordecai: Hey, Margaret.

Margaret: Were you guys talking about the concert?

Rigby: We were talking about a concert. Is the concert you're talking about Fist Pump?

Margaret: Haha, yeah, cool.

Mordecai: Wait, you're going?

Margaret: Yeah, I am. I know they're kinda old, but I remember them from when I was a kid. Besides, everyone is gonna be there. It's gonna be fun. You guys gonna go?

Mordecai: I'm totally gonna go.

Rigby: Oh, so now you wanna... (Mordecai punches him) Owww!

Mordecai: We'll be there.

Margaret: Cool....see you guys there. (she walks away)

Mordecai: Yeah....see ya.

Rigby: I can't believe you're going to a Fist Pump concert just for some lady pecs.

Mordecai: Rigby, one day you'll be old enough to understand the real reason that people go to concerts.

Rigby: Whatever, it's to listen to music: I already know that. Now, how are we going to get the money for those tickets?

Mordecai: Dude, it's gonna be easy. We just have to work some extra hours.

Rigby: Extra work? I don't even like regular work.

Mordecai: Do you like Fist Pump?

Rigby: Yes.

Mordecai: Hmm, then you like extra work.

Rigby: Hmm, fine.

Mordecai: Hmm. Hmm.

Rigby: Hmm. Hmm.

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmm. Hmm.

(Scene cuts to Skip's house)

Benson: Let me get this straight. You and Rigby want me to give you overtime, and even though you can't even finish the regular amount of work that you normally have, you want me to add on even more.

Mordecai: Yes.

Benson: Ah-ha-ha! No.

Rigby: Aw, come on, Benson, please. Fist Pump is playing at Slammers, and we don't have enough money for tickets.

Benson: Haha, are you serious? Fist Pump? You know what kind of people go to those concerts?

(Muscle Man stand on the cart while Hi Five Ghost drives it)

Muscle Man: Whoo! That's right, ladies, we got two tickets to Fist Pump. See ya later, grandmas!

Rigby: (grunts aggressively) Benson, you listen and you listen good. (Drops to the ground and pleads) Please Benson, please give us overtime! Please?

Benson: What's the big deal? It's just some talentless band.

Skips: Actually they aren't that bad, not that I'm into that stuff. We're pretty backed up though. I think you should give them the work.

Pops: Oh, I agree. I say if they want to see 'Pump Fist', then let them see 'Pump Fist'.

Benson: (sighs) Fine. You can work overtime.

Mordecai & Rigby: Ohhhhh!!!

Benson: Here's a list of things we need done, when you finish them, you'll get your money.

Mordecai & Rigby: Ohhhhh!!! (They leave)

Benson: (sighs) Idiots.

(A montage scene follows in which Mordecai and Rigby power through several chores at regular speed)

Rigby: Dude, I'm fading fast.

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. We just gotta fight it with coffee.

(They take a sip of coffee, and the montage scene resumes with faster music. The duo are back at work at ultra-high speed. Benson is pleasantly surprised at how sparkling the house is and hands over the overtime pay to Mordecai and Rigby. They vacuum it up before tearing open the vacuum bags to get the money back)

(The scene shifts to outside the Slammers club's box office)

Mordecai: Two for Fist Pump.

Guy in ticket stand: $400.

Mordecai & Rigby: What?

Mordecai: But I thought they were 50!

Guy in ticket stand: $50 tickets are sold out. All that's left are Super Deluxe front row seats.

Mordecai: Aw, man!

Rigby: No, no, no! Mordecai, wait, wait, man, we can't give up. Fist Pump...

Mordecai: I know, dude, but I just don't want to work anymor--. Oh my...

(Mordecai drools as he sees Margaret in her skimpy Fist Pump top. She waves as he stands in stunned amazement)

Mordecai: Maybe I could work a little more. Alright, dude, let's do this.

(Rigby is down on the ground sleeping)

Mordecai: You're lucky I care about lady pecs.

(The scene cuts back to outside Skips' house)

Mordecai: Benson, we need more money.

Rigby: (Takes a sip of coffee) Yeah, give us more money.

Benson: There's no more chores left. Unless... you want to mow the lawn.

Mordecai & Rigby: The lawn?

(We take a bird's eye view of the huge lawn)

Mordecai: Aw, what? That'll take forever.

Benson: Here's the keys. You know where the mower is. (He throws the keys to the duo. They hit Rigby on the face and he moans in pain.) Good luck. (Benson drives away on the golf cart)

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Who needs luck when we have coffee?

Mordecai & Rigby: (weakly) Ohhhhhh...

Rigby: Dude, seriously though, my eyes won't stay open anymore, and I think we're almost out of coffee.

Mordecai: Nonsense, dude, we got plenty of coffee. (Tries to take a sip from the coffee pot, but there is no more coffee, and he lays on the ground)

Rigby: Mordecai, what happened?

Mordecai: (weakly) Need more coffee. Need more Margaret.

Rigby: (weakly) Fist Pump.

Giant Coffee Bean: Coffee, coffee.

(A giant coffee bean clad in underpants and a headband appears on screen, along with a Japanese man in a business suit. It transpires that he is translating for the coffee bean )

GCB: Coffee?

Translator: Greetings, fellow Fist Pump fans. May we help you get some tickets?

Mordecai: What? Who are you?

Giant Coffee Bean: Coffee, coffee.

Translator: As you can see, I am a giant coffee bean. I can bring you caffeine. Do you accept?

Mordecai: Wait, what?

Giant Coffee Bean: Coffee coffee, coffee coffee coffee, coffee coffee, coffee coffee coffee.

(The coffee bean holds out a contract that only has the word 'coffee' on it several times)

Rigby: Ah, cool, a contract, let's sign it!

(Rigby signs the contract. The coffee bean takes it back, presses it to his stomach area, and absorbs it.)

Giant Coffee Bean: Coffee, coffee!

(He then grabs his nipples, screams, and shoots coffee into the mouths of Mordecai and Rigby)

(A montage plays in which Mordecai and Rigby pump their fists and drive the lawnmower, with the aid of the Giant Coffee Bean's regular infusions of more coffee. Working for the Weekend by Loverboy plays in the background. The montage ends as Mordecai and Rigby walk into their bedroom and shut the door, new tickets in hand)

Mordecai and Rigby: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

Mordecai: Aw, man, I didn't know deluxe tickets were coated in diamonds.

Rigby: So cool.

Translator: Where are the other two tickets?

(The coffee bean and his interpreter are already in the room)

Rigby: (shocked) Oh, jeez! (puting on his Fist Pump t-shirt) There's no 'other tickets', man. We only had enough for two.

Translator: But we had a contract.

Rigby: (screams) Woooooo!!! Fist pump!

Mordecai: (normal voice) Woo, Fist Pump.

Giant Coffee Bean: (angrily) Coffee, coffee, coffee!

(Rigby shows Mordecai a toy gun with a pumping fist on the end of it)

Rigby: Dude, check it. Bang bang! Dude, I've got two if you want to take one to the concert.

Translator: Mordecai and Rigby, we are very excited for you to be the ones to see Fist Pump. Please accept this coffee to help you make it through concert.

(Mordecai and Rigby accept the cups, which have tea bag strings hanging over the side)

Mordecai & Rigby: Thanks.

(The two take a slurp and begin looking sleepy)

Mordecai: Hey, what the...? this isn't coffee!

(The translator and the coffee bean laugh)

Interpreter: It's camomile tea. The sleepiest of all teas.

Mordecai: Rigby, get the...

(Rigby is already asleep as Mordecai falls to the floor)

Mordecai: ... tickets.

(The screen goes black, and lights up to see Mordecai awakened by a crashing noise outside. From the bedroom window he sees the coffee bean ready to drive away with the translator on the golf cart, complete with Mordecai and Rigby's Fist Pump clothes)

Mordecai: Hey!

(The coffee bean looks up before jumping in the cart and driving off)

Mordecai: Rigby, come on, they got the tickets! Come on, let's go, let's go!

(Rigby wakes up and feels his chest and notices his t-shirt is gone)

Rigby: (frustrated and tired) Fist Pump!

(The two run outside to see the coffee bean and translator heading down the driveway on the cart)

Rigby: Now what are we supposed to do?

Mordecai: Come on. I have an idea.

(The scene cuts to outside Skips' house. Benson is walking to the gas pump and whistling contentedly. Mordecai and Rigby bust through the garage door on the lawnmower, knocking Benson over as gumballs spill out of his front)

Benson: You morons, get back here and help me pick up my gumballs! (Clean version is the same, but 'morons' is replaced with 'idiots'.)

(A chase scene ensues)

Giant Coffee Bean: (threateningly) Coffee. (Subtitles display - "Take Care Of Them")

(Mordecai and Rigby pull up beside the cart)

Mordecai: Give us the tickets!

(The translator produces a chainsaw and pulls the power on. Mordecai and Rigby scream and duck as the Interpreter lunges at them, cutting some of the lawnmower off. As they continue the chase down the city streets, the chainsaw is knocked loose and Mordecai and Rigby are able to knock the roof from the cart, but eventually, both vehicles are abandoned as they reach Slammers, the cart crashing into the box office. The translator and coffee bean pick themselves up and race for the VIP entrance, but are intercepted by Mordecai and Rigby)

Translator: (nervously) Eh, Mordecai and Rigby. Funny seeing you here.

Mordecai: A chainsaw, are you serious?! I mean, what's up with the chainsaw?

Giant Coffee Bean: (angrily) Coffee! Coffee coffee!

Translator: Why didn't you buy us tickets?

Mordecai: What are you talking about? We never said we'd buy you tickets!

Translator: But we had a contract.

Rigby: Shut it!

(Rigby, leaning in, snatches the tickets from the Interpreter)

Mordecai: You know, at first I thought you were cool, but now, I know that you're both total losers.

Rigby: Everybody hates you.

Mordecai: Oh, and I just realized something.

Translator: What?

Mordecai: Your coffee sucks.

Mordecai and Rigby: Ohhhhhhh!!!

(The two dance through the VIP door unimpeded as the coffee bean and translator are turned away by the bouncer. Mordecai and Rigby are then shown walking down the stairs in the auditorium)

Llama Guy: 'Sup, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Hey, dude.

(Rigby sees the diamond-encrusted seats at the front and center of the room)

Rigby: Dude, there they are!

(Mordecai and Rigby run and jump onto their seats)

Rigby: We did it! Fist Pump! Fist Pump!

Mordecai: I wonder where Margaret's sittin'?

(Mordecai kneels up on his seat and turns around, only to receive a sweaty Fist Pump t-shirt to the face)

Mordecai: Aw, sick, it's all sweaty!

Muscle Man: Wooooo! I just threw my shirt!

(Several rows back, Muscle Man is shown lifting a weight while balancing on two seats)

Muscle Man: Bring out Fist Pump! Let's do it!

(The scene pans to Margaret a few rows in front)

Margaret: Hey, Mordecai!

Mordecai: Hey, Margaret! Fist Pump!

Margaret: Mordecai, you have to meet my boyfriend, Slasher!

(Mordecai's face collapses and he stops fist pumping)

Margaret: Hey, Slasher, that's my friend Mordecai.

Slasher: You should tell your friend he should stop pumpin' it in the wind and start pumpin' it at the gym.

(Margaret pulls her arm away from Slasher)

Margaret: (angrily) Don't be such a jerk.

Slasher: (quietly, to Mordecai) You're dead.

Mordecai: (laughs nervously and sinks into his seat) Oh, this sucks.

Rigby: (slurring) Aw, don't worry about her, you'll get another chance.

(Rigby and Mordecai look amazed as the crowd cheers. A truck with a flaming skull on the front appears at the side of the stage, the trucker blowing its horn)

Rigby: Hahaha, woo!

(Rigby turns to Mordecai only to see him snoring in his seat)

Rigby: Dude, wake up! They're about to come out!

(Rigby's eyes narrow)

Rigby: Wait... must... stay awake. Must... see best band of all... time! Hngh! (resigned) Aw, crap.

(Rigby falls asleep immediately and snores)

Fist Pump singer: 'Ello! We are Fist Pump! One, two, three, four!

Announcer on game: D-d-d-d-daaaaa-Dig Champs!

Rigby: Dude, these are probably the best graphics I've ever seen in my life.

Mordecai: Dude, it looks just like the cover.

(Mordecai and Rigby chuckle at the cover of the game and the game itself, with the cover obviously looking better and different then the actual game.)

Mordecai: Oh man. Dude, let's play it.

Rigby: Woah, woah, woah! You can't play game like this right out of the box. We should stretch it out first. We don't want to pull our "hammies," know what I'm sayin'? Hey, whatta ya doin'?

Mordecai: Starting. Hurry up, and, pick your character. Hehehe!

Rigby: Aw, what? I wanted to be player one!

Mordecai: Dude, I'm player one. You're player two.

Rigby: I don't wanna be player two! He just digs with a sucky pick axe! I want the one with the shovel!

Mordecai: Dude, they're exactly the same.

Rigby: Then why don't you be player two?

Mordecai: Pfft. I'm not using that sucky pick axe.

Rigby: (gasps) See?!

Mordecai: Dude, calm down. Let's play Punchies to see who gets to be player one.

Rigby: Fine.

(Rigby tries to punch Mordecai. He fails. Mordecai then punches Rigby and wins.)

Rigby: Ahh!

Mordecai: Looks like I'm player one.

Rigby: (on-screen) No! It's not fair! You always get your way! (Mockingly): Let's play Punchies, let's play Punchies. I'm sick of it! (off-screen) Of course I'm not gonna beat you at punchies.

Mordecai: Dude, you don't beat anybody at punchies.

Rigby: Yes I do.

Mordecai: No you don't.

(A series of flashbacks is shown. Rigby and Muscle Man are playing punchies. Muscle Man wins. Pops with his eyes closed punches Rigby to the wall.)

Rigby: (screams)

(In the last flashback, seemingly drunk Mordecai and Pops see also seemingly drunk Skips punch Rigby. Rigby is being taken off by a helicopter presumably to a hospital.)

Mordecai: We-oo! We-oo! We-oo! Quick, doctor, both of these butt cheeks are unrecognizable. If we want anyone to be able to recognize this as a butt in the future, then we're gonna have to do a complete butt transplant, stat!

Rigby: STOP TALKING!!! There was only damage to the one cheek and you know it!

Mordecai: Hahaha! That's right! We used to call you the One Cheek Wonder! Dude, I'm bringin' it back.

Rigby: You better not!

Muscle Man: Is that One Cheek wonder? I hope he's not trying to play Punchies with cheeks like that!

M&MM: (off-screen) Hahahahahaha!

(Close up of Rigby's butt cheeks. Rigby covers them with his tail.)

Rigby: Shut up! Don't look at them! I'll win at punchies, you'll see!

(Rigby runs to his and Mordecai's room.)

Rigby: Wahhh!!! (Jumps on Mordecai's bed.) Ugh! Ugh! Dumb Mordecai! I hate you!

Mordecai (downstairs): You better not be messing up my side of the room.

Rigby: (Yells and grabs a book) YOU'RE RUINING MY LIFE!!! (throws book at the door, it bounces of and hits him in the face) Oww!!! (screeches in pain continually off-screen)

(A frustrated Mordecai puts on headphones and plays the video game.)

Rigby: Ughh! Stupid bo... (notices) ...ok?

(An interested Rigby looks at the phone book, which says "Death Kwon Do.")

Rigby: Death Kwon Do? "Learn kicks, chops and punches in moments. Unlock your full potential today"? Yeees...

(Cut to the "Death Kwon Do" building.)

Sensei: It's a touching story. Really, it is. But I don't know if you're ready for Death Kwon Do.

Rigby: Why not?

Sensei: Death Kwon Do is all about self-defense. But, from the sound of it, you just want to hit harder.

Rigby: Uhhhh....no? Can you just teach me something?

Sensei: Hmm. Determination. I like that. Okay, I'll teach you some beginner defensive moves. All you gotta do is pick from the sacred text of Death Kwon Do.

(Sensei holds up a book titled "Death Kwon Do.")

Sensei: Let's see, we can start you off with "Bicep Flex of Death." Or there's the "Leg Lifts of Death." That's a good beginner's move. Or the "Pelvic Thrust of Death." That's one of my personal favorites.

(Rigby is searching for moves in the book.)

Rigby: That one. That's the one I want. "The Death Punch."

Sensei: That I'm afraid is not for beginners.

Rigby: What, why?

Sensei: Because you only want to use it to beat up your friends. You're not pure of heart!

Rigby: [on-screen] What? Don't call me "not pure of heart"! [off-screen] What about you with your crappy mullet? [on-screen] You're the one who's not pure of heart!

Sensei: (on-screen) That's it! I'm turning my back on you and counting to three, of death. And when I turn back around, (off-screen) you're toast! (on-screen) One of death. Two of death.

(A rip is heard. Rigby has ripped out "The Death Punch of Death.")

Sensei: NOOOOOOOOOOOO---

Death Kwon Do Student: Uhh...Sensei, uhh.., I think somebody just Death Kwon Clogged the toilet.

Sensei: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

("You're the Best Around" sung by Joe Esposito is heard during the montage. Rigby is trying to learn how to perform the "The Death Punch." Rigby fails, but learns how The Death Punch is used to have a mullet. He combs his hair into one, but still fails. He then learns you also have to wear cut jeans to perform it. He cuts the legs off of a pair of jeans and puts them on. He successfully performs The Death Punch by braking his and Mordecai's burrow. You're the Best Around fades away.)

Rigby: Whoa... Time to take this baby for a test drive.

(Rigby goes outside.)

Rigby: Huh-waaaaayyyyy! Hah! (targets Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost.)

Rigby: Heyy-yah! Heyy-yah! Heyyyyyyyyyy-yah! Hah! ("punches" Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost. Muscle Man hits the wall)

Muscle Man: Oh no, bro...

(Rigby then targets Pops.)

Rigby: Heyy-yah! (punches Pops up to the sun)

(Rigby then targets Skips.)

Rigby: Heyyyy-yah! (punches Skips all the way a park light, leaving a rut.)

Rigby: Hah! Mmmeeeh!

(Rigby explodes the Snack Bar. Then the park fountain. Then a carnival tent. And finally, a rock.)

Rigby: Uhhhhh-aughhhhh! You're next, Mordecai!!

(Cut to the door of the bathroom. Mordecai comes out. A flush sound is heard.)

Mordecai: Do-do. Do-do. Do-do, do-do, do-do. All right, Rigby, cry baby time's over. Come on, let's go get some food. I'm buying.

(Mordecai notices Rigby's destruction of their room.)

Mordecai: Aw, what? Rigby! Aughhhhh! He's gonna pay for this. (Picks up the phone book.) Death Kwon Do?

Rigby: Where are you, Mordecai? I wanna play you punchies!

(Mordecai looks through the shades of his and Rigby's window.)

Rigby: Hey, mister, have you seen Mordecai?

Man 1: Uhhhh.., no. W-who's..(Rigby punches the Man.) Ughhhhhh!

Rigby: Have you seen him?

Man 2: Seen w-ughhhhh! (Rigby punches the second man.)

Rigby: How 'bout you?

(Punches the third man up on the window.)

Man 3: Ughhhh! Uhhhhhh........

Mordecai: Oh, so you think you're gonna beat me at punchies? Well, I've got news for you. I know your little secret.

(Cut to the park. The park is destroyed beyond repair.)

Dog 1: Rowr, rowr, rowr, rowr!

Dog 2: Uhmmm.

Rigby: Now massage this foot!

Skips: But I already did that one.

Rigby: Then rub it again! Unless you want to get punched again. And Pops, what's with the easy-breezy? Speed it up! My pepperonis are roasting down here!

Pops: Uhh-hmm!

Rigby: Muscle Man, you see Mordecai yet?

Muscle Man: Uhhh, I can't see anything. (he lowers the binoculars, revealing two black eyes)

Mordecai: I'm right here, Rigby.

Rigby: Gimme those!

(Notices Mordecai's attire. His hair is in a mullet and he is wearing jean shorts like Rigby.)

Rigby: Looks like you've learned the ways of Death Kwon Do.

Mordecai: Looks like you know how to say things people are already aware of.

Rigby: Whatever! You can't handle The Death Punch!

Mordecai: That sounds like a challenge.

Rigby: That's because maybe it IS a challenge!

Mordecai: Well then what're you doing up there?

Rigby: Muscle Man, Hi Fives, carry me down.

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost carry Rigby down to Mordecai.)

Rigby: Don't drop me! Be careful! Woah, woah! Leaning, leaning! Here, here! Set me here. What move did you learn?

Mordecai: Why don't you come over here and find out.

Rigby: Hmm! Heyyyyyyyaaaaaahuhuhuh-hah!

(Rigby punches Mordecai.)

Rigby: What?

(Mordecai is not injured.)

Rigby: How come you're not dead yet?

Mordecai: Probably because I learned "The Death Block." (He holds up the page for it.) It worked pretty good for a first try, either that or your Death Punch totally blows.

Rigby: I'LL KILL YOU!!!! Yayhyhyhyhy!

Mordecai: Hmm-hmm. You're never gonna beat me at punchies.

Rigby: Nyyayayayahah!

(Rigby repeatedly punches Mordecai, albeit failing, as the hole surrounding the two gets wider and deeper and Skips, Pops, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost watch the impact.)

Rigby: (panting)

Mordecai: Are you finished yet?

Rigby: Not until I smash you!!!!! Hyhaaw! (He punches Mordecai again and begins panting, but suddenly, a crack rips up the wall causing rock and soil to fly out, the lava starts to ooze out of the crack.)

Mordecai: Whoa.

Rigby: What? Are you afraid of a little lava? Hyayaaha! (Because of the punches, more cracks and lava occur.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is serious! We've gotta get out of here!

Rigby: Never! Not until I beat you at punchies! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! (more lava spews)

Mordecai: Dude, stop! We're gonna die!

Rigby: I don't care!!! I'm sick of you always winning!!!!

(Mordecai has a realization about Rigby's statement. In the flashbacks, he first punches Rigby in his arm. And again. And again. Then on his side. Then on his back. And finally, in his crotch.)

Rigby: I'm not quitting 'till I win!!!

(Rigby continually punches Mordecai.)

Rigby: Heh-huh. Heh-huh. Heh-huh.

Mordecai: (faking) Aw! You got me, you got me! Aw, you got me! You win! We have to stop now 'cause I lost.

Rigby: Hah! I told ya I was gonna win! In yo face! Yay-hay-hay! I finally get to be player one!

Mordecai: What?! That's what this is about?! You just wanted to be player one?!

Rigby: Huh! That's all I ever wanted!

Mordecai: Dude, you can totally be player one.

Rigby: (sobs)

Mordecai: Dude, quit crying. I said you could be player one.

Rigby: I know, but what good is being player one now? We're just gonna die in this lava!!!

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. I can get us away from the lava.

Rigby: Really? How?

Mordecai: You think I'm dumb enough to steal only one Death Kwon Do move?

Rigby: Wha-?

Mordecai: Now, how do you wanna get outta here? "The Death Jump" or "The Death Dump"?

Rigby: Aw, sick!!! Better go with the Death Jump.

Mordecai: Hold on tight.

(Mordecai flies up to the sky holding Rigby.)

Pops: Look!

Sensei: Why, yes sir, I have the Death Jump, and the Death Dump right he-- (opens the notebook... only to find both the Death Jump and Death Dump pages ripped out, courtesy of Mordecai) NOOOOOOOOOO--

Announcer on game: Da-da-da-da-da--Dig Champs!

Rigby: Aw, yes! It's finally happening!

Mordecai: Yep. For once being a huge baby actually worked out for you.

Rigby: Stop talking!!!!!!!!

Mordecai: Hah-ha-hah. Dude, just hurry up and play. You're just gonna die right at the beginning anyway.

Rigby: Mah-mah-mah-mah-mah-mah. Unn. I'll show you.

(Rigby plays the game. He is killed by a snail.)

Rigby: Aw, what? Snails are bad? I thought snails were good!

Mordecai: No, dude, snails are bad.

Rigby: Aw, man. This sucks... I wanna be player two.

Rigby: Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man! Mordecai, check it out! I found it in the trash in the back. Isn't it cool?

(Rigby brings a cracked plate decorated with a face and words SIMON KIPNER GODFATHER OF THE SOUL PATCH)

Mordecai: Dude, you gotta stop pulling stuff out of the trash. It's unnatural.

Rigby: You're unnatural! Besides, this is different. It's a treasure from the past.

Mordecai: It is a pretty sweet plate.

Rigby: We should put some food on this baby!

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Agreed. You know what would look great on this plate? Chocolate cake!

Rigby: Ahhhhh, yes. But how can we afford something as good as chocolate cake?

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. I think I know where we can get one.

(Mordecai and Rigby are at the grocery store)

Mordecai (continued): Check it, dude. Cake mix. Add some water, slap it in the oven, pull that greasy pig out and BAM! You've got yourself a cake, baby.

Rigby: I can't wait to eat that greasy pig. Wait, how much does it cost?

Mordecai: (Looks at the box) A buck fifty.

Mordecai & Rigby: Aaaargh!

Rigby: I told you cake mix is too expensive.

(Mordecai and Rigby go to a wedding)

Doorman: Do you know the bride or the groom?

Mordecai and Rigby: Uhhh..

Mordecai: The one with the cake?

(The doorman shuts the door)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ugghhh!!

(Mordecai and Rigby go to the free store)

Cashier at the free store: Yeah, we don't have cakes.

(Mordecai and Rigby groan, scene cuts to the house)

Mordecai: (Sighs) Well, I'm all out of ideas.

Rigby: Ooh! I got it! There's that chocolate cake at the snack bar!

Mordecai: Yeah. But, Benson will only let you have it for free if it's your birthday.

Rigby: Who's to say it's not my birthday?

Mordecai: Who's to say it's not my birthday?

Mordecai & Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Benson: It's neither of your birthdays.

Rigby: Aw, man! He's killing us with that!

Mordecai & Rigby: (Sadly) No cake. No cake.

Pops: But it is Skips' birthday.

Mordecai & Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Benson: But he's really private about it.

Mordecai & Rigby: (Sadly) No cake. No cake.

Benson: Come to think of it, I don't think we've ever had a party for Skips.

Pops: If memory serves, Skips secludes himself in the woods every year on the day of his birth.

Mordecai: So, wait? You guys have never thrown a party for Skips?

Benson: No.

Mordecai: Dude, that sucks. Skips totally deserves a party.

Rigby: (Who interrupts) And cake.

Mordecai: Whenever something goes wrong, it's Skips who fixes it. He’s always there for us, no matter what. I bet Skips wants a party, but he's such a quiet guy he doesn't know how to ask. We owe him a party.

Rigby: And also a cake.

Pops: Woo! Good show, jolly good show! Benson, a soiree for Skips, what a crackerjack idea!

Benson: You're right. Fine. If you two get Skips on board, we'll throw a party for him.

Mordecai: Oh, we know how to get him on board.

(We cut back to the house)

Mordecai (continued): Okay. How will we get him on board?

Rigby: Oh, I know! Let's get a van.

(Dream Mordecai and Dream Rigby throw an unconscious Dream Skips into a van)

Dream Rigby: Happy birthday, Skips.

Rigby: BAM! Free cake!

Mordecai: No, dude. That’s kidnapping.

Rigby: But we can't just tell him. You heard Benson, Skips isn't into this stuff.

Mordecai: I know, but dude, Skips is cool. We should just go and tell him we gonna throw him a party.

Rigby: Argh, laaaame!

Mordecai: What? What's wrong with that?

Rigby: Two things: one, no surprise, and two, no vans.

Mordecai: (gasp) That's it.

Rigby: What, vans?

Mordecai: No, Surprise. Dude, we should throw Skips a surprise party!

Rigby: Dude, that's perfect!

Mordecai: Yeah, I know. 'Cause no one can say NO to a surprise party.

Rigby: 'Cause they can't.

Mordecai and Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Skips: No, I don't wanna hang out with you guys at 8 o'clock tonight.

Mordecai: Well, then... How about later tonight?

Skips: No! I wanna be left alone!

Mordecai: Argh, man. What would we do now?

Rigby: Dude, Check it. We'll just lie to Benson and get the cake first, and figure out the Skips part later.

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm. Sounds like a cake worthy idea to me.

Mordecai and Rigby: Free cake! Free cake!

Mordecai: Skips totally wants a birthday party.

Benson: Really? How did you convince him?

Mordecai: We told him there's gonna be cake.

Rigby: Yeah, he wants an extra-large chocolate one.

Benson: Really?

Mordecai: Yeah. 8:00. His place.

Rigby: But he wants it to be a surprise, so if you see him, don't say anything. (Mordecai punches Rigby.) Ow!

Benson: Okay. Here's the key to the cake in the snack bar. I guess I’ll see you at 8. But if you morons are lying to me, you'll be on dish duty for the next month!!

Mordecai: We did it!

Rigby: Let's eat it!

Mordecai: No! You heard Benson. Do you wanna be on dish duty?

Rigby: Arghhhhhhh, fine. We'll do dish duty.

Mordecai: No, dude. We have to get Skips.

(Mordecai and Rigby walk through the woods. Rigby carries the cake.)

Rigby: Are you sure Skips is even here?

Mordecai: Pops said Skips secludes himself in the woods. Where else should we look? (Rigby's stomach rumbles.) Don't touch that cake.

Rigby: It's a medical emergency.

Mordecai: You just ate a sandwich.

Rigby: Are you a doctor now? Did you go to medical school in the past 5 minutes?

Mordecai: We're saving it for the party, and that's THAT.

(Mordecai takes the cake from Rigby.)

(At Skips’ place.)

Benson: Do you see them?

Pops: Not yet.

Benson: Hit the lights. It's almost 8 p.m.

Muscle Man: Whooooo! Skips is gonna be so surprised when he comes in and sees us totally naked.

Benson: It's not that kind of party, Muscle Man.

Muscle Man: Ohhhh... Don't turn on the lights.

(In the woods.)

Rigby: Ohhhh, man, it's almost 8. We're not gonna find him, let's just eat it.

Mordecai: No. Benson's gonna get pissed, so we shouldn’t. (In reruns, the line is changed to "Benson's gonna get ticked, so we shouldn't.")

Rigby: Benson's gonna get like that no matter what. (Grabs the cake from Mordecai.) Better to have no regrets.

Mordecai: Dude! No! (Grabs the cake back. Rigby jumps on Mordecai trying to get the cake.) RIGBY! GET OFF! (Mordecai throws Rigby off and tries to run away with the cake, but Rigby gets him. They fight over the cake.) Dude! Quit it! You're ruining the cake! (A mysterious sound is heard.) Wait. What's that? Sounds like some kind of weird Aztec ritual... (Mordecai and Rigby stop fighting. While Mordecai was puzzling over the sound Rigby sneakily obtained the cake.) I think it's coming from over there. We should go to check it out.

Rigby: That's funny. Usually, if there's a strange noise in the woods, you don't check it out. Mordecai? (They see Skips singing and jumping around a blue-colored bonfire with a big rattle.) What's Skips doing?

Mordecai: I don't know. But it looks kind of important. Maybe we should leave him alone.

Rigby: What about the cake?

Mordecai: Would you forget about the cake for a minute? Rigby!

(Rigby interrupts Skips.)

Rigby: You're coming with us, Skips!

Skips: What are you doing?!? (The bonfire goes out.) Fools! You interrupted my spirit dance! You don't realize what you've done!

(A white pickup lands near them.)

Gary: Skips. You have broken the pact with the Guardians of Youth.

Skips: Gary, You don't have to do this!

Gary: Listen. I'm just doing my job.

(Both teleport into the pickup.)

Mordecai: Wait! Where are you taking him?

Gary: I'm only the chauffeur.

(The pickup leaves.)

Mordecai: Dude, I think we just screwed Skips!

Rigby: And ourselves! No Skips, no cake!

Mordecai: Come on. We better follow him. (They jump into the trunk. The pickup arrives onto a sandy island in the space.) Dude. What the...

Rigby: Dude. What's with the babies? We've got to get Skips back to the park.

Mordecai: Shh! Shut up!

Gary: Guardians of Eternal Youth. I have brought you the condemned.

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Skips. You have failed to complete the Spirit Dance. And thus the pact you made with us for eternal youth has been broken. Now you shall shrivel into dust and disappear, Forever.

(The Guardians of Eternal Youth blast Skips with energy beams. Skips turns very old and collapses to the ground.)

Mordecai and Rigby: SKIPS!!!!!

(Skips starts crumbling to dust.)

Mordecai: Wait! It's not his fault!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: What's done is done.

Mordecai: But this is our fault! We interrupted the dance before he could finish!

Rigby: Yeah, man. Let him finish that dance thing!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: The decision of the Guardians cannot be overturned.

(Skips continues crumbling to dust.)

Mordecai & Rigby: SKIPS!!!!!

Mordecai: We're sorry, Skips.

Rigby: Yeah, we're sorry.

Mordecai: (sniffles) We just wanna to throw you a surprise party.

Rigby: Yeah. It was going to be really cool. We were gonna eat cake...

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Cake? Did someone say cake?

Rigby: No. There’s no cake.

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Wait, brothers. I smell cake. Do you smell it as well?

Guardian of Eternal Youth 2: I smell cake.

Guardian of Eternal Youth 3: As do I! Cake! Cake!

Mordecai: Wait. You guys like cake?

Guardians of Eternal Youth: Yes! Yes! We love it!

Mordecai: Give me the cake, dude.

Rigby: No way!

(Mordecai grabs the cake from Rigby.)

Mordecai: So, you're telling me you like cake?

Guardian of Eternal Youth: The blue one has cake. Cake. Give us the cake!

Mordecai: Nah, The cake for Skips.

Rigby: Mordecai, what are you doing?

Mordecai: Dude. Do you want Skips to die on his birthday?

(Skips is almost dead.)

Rigby: Alright.

Mordecai: Do we have a deal?

(Guardians of Youth decide to debate a situation.)

Guardian of Eternal Youth: What flavor is it?

Mordecai: Chocolate.

Guardian of Eternal Youth: We have reached a new decision. We will restore Skips' youth in exchange, for your cake.

(Mordecai puts the cake on the ground.)

Mordecai: Now change him back!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Done!

(Skips returns back to normal. Guardians of Youth start smearing themselves with the cake.)

Rigby: Aw, what? They are not even eating it! They're just smushing it on their faces!

Guardian of Eternal Youth: Be gone with you.

(Mordecai, Rigby and Skips disappear and materialize at Skips' place.)

Benson, Pops, Muscle Man, Hi Five Ghost: Surprise!

Pops: Let the merry making commence! (laughs)

Skips: You guys almost killed me for some cake?

Rigby: Hey, Skips. We've got you a birthday present. (Rigby gives Skips the plate he found in a trash.) It says: SKIPS --- GODFATHER OF SOUL.

Skips: No one's ever thrown me a birthday party before. Thanks.

Benson: So, where's the cake?

Mordecai: Ahh, cake?

Rigby: I don't remember anything about cake.

Mordecai: Me neither.

Rigby: Must be a misunderstanding.

Mordecai: Oh, The cake from the snack bar.

Rigby: You wanted that cake for this party?

Mordecai: Ha-ha-ha! Oh, man! I mean what a mix-up, right?

Rigby: The important thing is we are all together.

Benson: Argh. I knew I couldn't trust you idiots. You're lucky Pops brought a spare. Happy birthday, Skips.

Mordecai: Ha-ha! Yes! Finally! (Takes a piece of the cake.) Argh, Vanilla...?

Benson: Everyone ready for the barbecue? How's everything coming, Pops?

Pops: I've been making pies all morning! (He laughs and brings out the pies.)

Benson: Skips?

Skips: I made Chilli.

Benson: Well I have a little surprise. I was getting excited for the annual barbecue so in addition for putting on this shirt (he is wearing a red shirt that had white flowers on it) I splurged on some Super Extra Premium Grade A Hot Dogs.

Pops: Oh, it's been a while since I had a grilled meat link.

Skips: So where'd you get them?

Benson: I got them online. I spared no expense, I even paid extra for overnight shipping.

Skips: So where are they? Let's throw those babies on the grill.

Benson: I gave them to Rigby.

Skips: Huh?

Pops: Oh, are Mordecai and Rigby grilling already?

Benson: No, no, I just told them to bring them outside. I definitely told them NOT to grill the hot dogs.

(At the picnic area, Mordecai and Rigby are standing around, with Rigby holding the hot dogs.)

Mordecai: You sure Benson said we could grill the hot dogs?

Rigby: Benson totally said we could grill the hot dogs.

Mordecai: Sweet! (He takes the hot dogs from Rigby.)

Rigby: Let's get grillin'.

Mordecai: Chillin' and Grillin'!

Mordecai & Rigby: Yeah-yuh!

Mordecai: Whoa, Benson spared no expense. Real ingredients? Dude, these are like luxury hot dogs. (He puts them on the grill) Dude, this thing won't light.

Rigby: I know how to get that baby going. (He grabs lighter fluid from the table) Outta my way.

(He puts the lighter fluid on the hot dogs, and starts the grill, continuing to put it on the hot dogs.)

Mordecai: Okay, dude, I think that's good.

Rigby: What?

(The grill explodes, then the hotdogs catch fire)

Rigby: I got it!

(He takes the tablecloth and puts it on the fire, yet it makes it worse, causing Mordecai to roar. Mordecai and Rigby take the grill as fast as they can and Mordecai drops the grill over the bridge and into the river. The burned hot dogs float away.)

Rigby: Aw, man. I guess that's why Benson told me NOT to grill.

Mordecai: What?!

(Mordecai drags the grill back to the picnic area, with the grill dripping wet.)

Rigby: I said I was sorry. Come on, man.

Mordecai: No! No more "Come on, man"s. Benson's gonna totally blame me and it's all your fault! I'm sick of you always gettin' me into trouble!

Rigby: I just wanted to grill time with my bro. Chillin' and Grillin'.

(Mordecai puts his arms up.)

Rigby: No. No, don't.

Mordecai: It's too late. (He begins to move his arms together.)

Rigby: Come on, dude. Don't!

Mordecai: It's already in motion.

Rigby: Well, put it out of motion!

(Mordecai has finally crossed his arms)

Mordecai: You pissed me off. (In reruns, the line is changed to "You ticked me off.")

Rigby: Augh! Dude, no. Look at me. (He punches Mordecai, but no effect) Look at me! (He punches him again multiple times with the same results) Augh! If I fix it, will you stop being mad at me?

Mordecai: Maybe.

Rigby: Fine, I'll fix it. I'll just go get some more hot dogs from the meat locker down in the basement. Benson will never know, okaaaaaaaaay?

Mordecai: Fine. You'd better fix it, though.

(Mordecai and Rigby go down to the meat locker as Rigby opens the doors.)

Mordecai: Augh, I hate goin' down in the meat locker.

(They both go to meat locker and Mordecai holds the door. Rigby is looking for the hot dogs.)

Rigby: Don't worry, it'll be super quick, man. I'll get the hot dogs, you hold the door.

Mordecai: Fine.

Rigby: Meat, meat, meat, meat.

Mordecai: Hurry up, dude. It's freezing.

Rigby: I can't find 'em.

Mordecai: Argh! I knew you couldn't fix it!

Rigby: Wait! I think they're on top, but I can't reach.

Mordecai: I'll grab 'em. Come hold the door.

(Rigby goes to hold the door while Mordecai looks for the hotdogs.)

Mordecai: I don't see 'em.

(Rigby approaches Mordecai.)

Rigby: Did you check over there?

Mordecai: Yeah, I already... DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! THE DOOR!

Rigby: Oh, my gosh! I totally propped it open with some bags of ice! Check it.

(The ice bags fall and the door slams shut. Mordecai gets mad and is about to cross his arms.)

Rigby: Wait, wait! I can fix it, there's a safety latch!

(Rigby goes to it and begins pulling it.)

Mordecai: Dude, don't force it!

(The latch breaks and Mordecai and Rigby are banging on the door for help.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Benson! Skips! Help! Pops! HELP!!!!!

(Skips, Benson and Pops hang out in the kitchen. Benson and Pops encourage Skips to drink as much Soda as he can.)

Benson & Pops: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Yeeeeeeeeaaaaahwoooooooo! (Pops cackles)

(Back to the meat locker.)

Mordecai: Arghhhh!!! You did it to me again, man!

Rigby: Don’t worry. I’ll get us out of this.

(Rigby tries to break the meat locker door window with a big veal leg 10 times.)

Mordecai: Just give it up, dude. I knew you couldn’t fix it.

Rigby: Dude, I fix stuff all the time.

Mordecai: No, you don’t.

Rigby: What do you mean?

Mordecai: The cart, the shoes, the party. That other party.

Rigby: Stop right there! You know Muscle Man pushed me.

Mordecai: Muscle Man wasn’t even there!

Rigby: Fine, I’ll fix it.

Mordecai: You mean, like when you fixed the grill? Or when you fixed the hot dogs by burning them. Or... Oh, no, wait, I know. You mean, like you brought us down and locked us in the freezer to find more hot dogs? Oh, but surprise, surprise, there are no hot dogs.

Rigby: But I can...

Mordecai: No! Don’t even say it! Just shut up so I can find a way out of here before we freeze to death.

(After walking away, he chills his breath)

Rigby: Mordecai! I found the thermostat! I can totally fix it!

Mordecai (with blocked nose): Oh, no. (He looks behinds and finds Rigby holding a frozen drumstick) WHAT ARE YOU DOIN' WITH THAT DRUMSTICK?!?!

(Rigby hits a duct with the drumstick, causing the temperature to drop severely. Rigby hops out of the way and Mordecai takes the freezing cold while groaning with anger.)

Rigby: Mordecai, I’m sorry! Let me try and fix it!

Mordecai: ARGHHHHHHHHHH!!! I’m sick of you saying that! You can’t fix this, okay? All you do is mess things up and ruin people’s lives!

Rigby (distressfully): Sorry. I just wanted to help.

Mordecai: Stop pretending like you do anything but get me in trouble! You can’t fix anything! And now... I’m gonna d-d-die because of you.

(Mordecai puts his arms up.)

Rigby: No! (Mordecai crosses them) Dude, don’t be mad at me! Mordecai, DON’T DIE MAD AT ME!

(Mordecai turns away.)

Mordecai: Too.. late.

(Mordecai falls to the floor unconscious. Rigby kneels down and touches Mordecai's face.)

Rigby: Mordecai? Mordecai? (He stops touching Mordecai's face) Oh, no! Oh, no! I can fix this! I can fix this! (Walks away and puts Mordecai's legs on his shoulders and drags Mordecai away.) Don’t worry, Mordecai. I’m gonna take care of us. You’ll see. (Montage goes to Rigby looking for the hot dogs in tall boxes. He doesn't find them and picks up Mordecai's ankles and walks off. Next scene goes to Rigby carrying Mordecai by his neck, and then we see Mordecai's body being pushed off by Rigby. Next scene shows Rigby looking tired and weak, and holding Mordecai by his chest.) How am I doing? Ah, Mordecai? Am I doin' all right? (He gently moves Mordecai's head like a puppet and pretends that Mordecai is speaking.) “Yeah, Rigby, you’re doin' good.” (He drops Mordecai's body and stumbles on a box with hot dogs.) Hot dogs. I’ve been looking all over for you.

Hot Dog: Please, frozen stranger, can you free us?

Rigby: Yeah, I can free you. But you're gonna have to do something for me. Here’s what you gotta do...

(Mordecai is still unconscious, and he dreams about Margaret and him on a island. She is wearing a seashell bikini top and a grass skirt)

Dream Margaret: Hey, Mordecai.

(Mordecai has a muscular body.)

Dream Mordecai: Margaret. You look stunning.

Dream Margaret: Spin with me.

Dream Mordecai and Dream Margaret: Ha-ha-ha-ha!

Dream Margaret: Oh, Mordecai.

Dream Mordecai: Oh, Margaret.

(A giant Dream Rigby rises up from the sand.)

Dream Rigby: Mordecai! (In a deep, manly voice) I’M GONNA FIX IT!

(Mordecai wakes up.)

Mordecai (groaning): Rigby?

(Mordecai sees the Hot dog leader shaking hands with Rigby.)

Rigby: Oh, hey, you’re awake! (He goes to Mordecai and helps him sit up by putting his hands on his shoulders) Mordecai, Mordecai, I told you I can fix it! (The hotdogs are by Mordecai's legs) While you were dead, I found those talking hot dogs and they're gonna help us.

Mordecai (weakly): What?

Rigby: They said they know the way out!

Hot Dog Leader: It’s true. We can guide you out of the meat locker. But only if you will agree to take us to a barbecue where we can be eaten.

Mordecai: What? You WANT to be eaten?

Hot Dog Leader: Yes. It is our destiny to be eaten.

Mordecai: Dude, this is weird. Benson’s gonna know these are not the hot dogs he bought. Look at them!

Rigby: No. he won’t know, just trust me. I promise, it’ll work out.

Hot Dog Leader: Do we have a deal?

(Rigby shakes the hot dog leader’s hand.)

Hot dog Leader: It’s a deal!

(All hot dogs cheer. A portable cooler appears from the floor. Its cover opens and Rigby peeps in there.)

Rigby: Dude, this is the way out!

(The same cooler appears at the barbecue place.)

Rigby: Dude, they're not here yet! We still have time!

(Rigby, Mordecai and hot dogs come out from the cooler.)

Benson: Man, I can’t wait for those hot dogs!

Mordecai: Here they come. This'd better work.

Rigby: It’ll work. Just relax.

Benson: Hey, hey!

Rigby: Hey, Benson, I’ve got the hot dogs right here. I didn’t grill ‘em, just like you said.

Benson: Oh, boy, this is gonna be the best barbecue ever!

(The leader jumps up)

Hot dog Leader: NOW!

Mordecai: What the?

Benson: What the heck are those?!

(Hot dogs attack everyone.)

Rigby: This wasn’t part of the deal!

(Hot dogs force Benson, Pops, Skips and Mordecai into somewhere.)

Rigby: Wait!

Hot Dog Leader: Ha-ha-ha! You fell for our trap. Brilliantly. We don’t want to be eaten, we want to eat YOU.

Rigby: But what about the prophecy?

Hot Dog Leader: There is no prophecy. This is simply revenge. For all our fallen brother and sister hot dogs massacred by the hand of your barbecue. And now, you’ll join your friends awaiting a similar fate!

(Mordecai, Benson, Skips, and Pops are trapped in a giant plastic bag of steaming hot red oil.)

Benson: Help, Rigby!

Pops: Bad show.

Skips: Help!

Mordecai: Help!

Rigby: No! What are you doing to them?!

Hot Dog Leader: Marinating them, of course. Bag the last one!

(Rigby tries to escape by throwing barbecue stuff at the hot dogs.)

Rigby: Stand back, man! Stand back!

(Rigby runs out of stuff to protect himself with. But when he accidentally squirts mustard at one of the hot dogs, two other hot dogs surprisingly start to eat each him.)

Hot Dog #1: Awhhh! This stuff’s delicious!

(Rigby realizes what to do. He squirts mustard at every hot dog. Hot dogs slay each other. Benson, Pops, Skips, and Mordecai manage to get out of the bag.)

Benson: What the heck was that? What did you do?

Mordecai: Yeah, Rigby. What did you do?

Rigby: Uh, well, I... Ahhhh.... (He gasps and notices an empty plastic package of Super Extra Premium Hot Dogs.) Don’t look at me, Benson’s the one who went and bought the crazy Super Premium psycho Hot Dogs!

Skips: Oh, yeah! He’s right.

Pops: I indeed remember now.

(Rigby winks at Mordecai.)

Mordecai: Yeah, he’s right.

Rigby: Yeah, this wouldn't have happened if you'd just bought regular hot dogs!

Skips: That’s for sure.

Pops: That is true.

Benson: No, but... I don’t know what happened.

Rigby: Well, I guess the barbecue is ruined now thanks to Benson.

Pops: No!

Skips: What?

Benson: No, no, no, no, I can fix it. (He gives Rigby $20 and whispers to him.) Quick. Go and buy some hot dogs from the store and make sure they’re regular. (to the others) I’m sorry, guys. Minor setback.

Skips: I hope the overnight shipping was worth it.

Mordecai: Dude, that was awesome.

Rigby: I told you I’d fix it.

Mordecai: I knew that you would.

Rigby: Mordecai! Mordecai! Oh, there you are. You want half of this grilled cheese?

Mordecai: Whoa! Is that a grilled cheese deluxe from Cheezer's?

Rigby: Yes, it is.

Mordecai: Then, yes.

(They eat the sandwiches)

Mordecai: How did you manage this?

Rigby: I bought it. With money.

Mordecai: Nice! Hey, you know what would go good with these sandwiches? Funny internet videos! Dude, check this out. (Begins typing in name on the keyboard)

Rigby: No, wait! I know a really good one. (Types on the keyboard)

Mordecai: No, man! You’re just gonna pull up that ostrich thing with the balls again.

Rigby: No, I’m not.

Mordecai: You’re typing it in! I see it!

Rigby: Dude, don’t look! You’re gonna ruin it!

Mordecai: Fine. It better not be that ostrich thing with the balls. Ready yet?

Rigby: It’s loading. Okay... Now!

(Mordecai un-covers his eyes to see a video about an ostrich playing baseball while an old man watches it.)

Woman: (In video, off-screen) Don’t get too close now, Pa!

(The ostrich hits a baseball off the tee, pecks the old man in the groin, and raises its wings. Rigby laughs.)

Mordecai: Man, it’s that ostrich thing with the balls! Why do you gotta lie to me, dude?

Rigby: ‘Cause lying’s my specialty.

(Benson comes in very angry.)

Benson: What are you doing with my sandwich?!

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Don’t worry. I’ll take care of this with my specialty. This isn’t your sandwich. This is our sandwich.

Benson: This is your sandwich, huh? Then how come it says "Benson" on the bag?

Rigby: Huh? it’s supposed to say "Rigby," but they misspelled my name wrong.

Benson: STOP LYING!!!

Mordecai: Dude, I thought you said you bought this!

Benson: No, he didn't buy it! Now get off your lazy butts and go get me another Grilled Cheese Deluxe!!! (Slams the door shut)

Mordecai: Argh! You ruined our day off!

Rigby: Ah, don’t worry, dude. The line won’t be that long.

(Scene goes to Cheezer’s. The line is extremely long.)

Mordecai: Thanks for saving the day with your specialty, you idiot.

Rigby: Whatever. Like you could do any better.

Mordecai: Pfff. I’m a better liar than you are.

Rigby: Oh, really? The only thing you’re better than me at is being a big piece of-

(Mordecai punches Rigby in the stomach. Meanwhile two astronauts in blue jackets, Barry & Jones, go around the line and enter the restaurant.)

Mordecai: Hey! Argh! What the...? Those pork loins are cutting! Argh!

Fat woman: Excuse me! Those fine men are astronauts! They can cut in line. They fought for our country! Huh!

Rigby: (Rises off the ground and gasps) Dude, here’s your chance to prove you’re a better liar than me. Or maybe you can’t? Look at your face. (Touches Mordecai's face all around) It must really eat you up inside to not be able to prove you’re a better liar than me. ‘Cause you can prove nothing. You, Can’t, Prove, Anything!

Mordecai: (Slaps away Rigby's hand and picks him up) Fine! You want me to prove I’m a better liar than you? Why wouldn’t we see who is better in lying? Whoever gets caught first loses.

Rigby: Okay. It’s not like you’re ever gonna lie better than thi-i-is...

(Mordecai drops Rigby.)

Mordecai: Ahem, excuse me, Miss.

Fat woman: What?

Mordecai: We're astronauts. (They enter the Cheezer’s, cutting in line.) Bam! I told you I’m a better liar than you!

Rigby: Woah, woah, woah! Step aside. I’ll show you how a real man lies. (Approaches a counter) Hey, baby. Give me a Grilled Cheese Deluxe and make it snappy, ‘cause we’re astronauts and we gotta get back up in space. Know what I’m sayin’?

Cheezer's Cashier: Oh, my. (Speaks using a loudspeaker) One Grilled Cheese Deluxe for the astronauts. (The announcement arouses the real astronauts’ curiosity.) That’ll be two fifty.

Rigby: Bam! That’s a moon quarter. (Points to a quarter)

Cheezer's Cashier: Oh! (Takes the money)

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. See?

Mordecai: Dude, that was lame.

Cheezer's Cashier: Excuse me, sir. Your Grilled Cheese is ready.

Mordecai: Thanks. We gotta get this back to our astronaut captain. Know what I’m sayin'? Hmm! Hmm!

Cheezer's Cashier: Oh, is that your astronaut captain over there?

Mordecai: Huh? (Sees Rigby talking with Barry & Jones) ARGHHHH!!! (Comes up to them)

Rigby: This is the guy.

Jones: (Very indignant) You’re the guy?

Mordecai: I’m...

Rigby: Hmm, hmm!

Mordecai: (Unsure) I’m the guy...

Jones: (Suddenly, Jones turns very excited. He is about to shake Mordecai’s hand.) Well! It’s an honor to meet you, captain. Lieutenant Riggs here has told us a lot about you.

Barry: Yeah, it’s great to meet a couple of real fellow astronauts.

Jones: So, what are you guys doing in this dump hole, anyways?

Rigby: Ah, you know. We're just pickin' up a Grilled Cheese for our commanding officer.

Barry: Ha-ha! I hear that.

Mordecai: Ha, yeah. We were just getting ready to take it back to the compound.

Jones: Compound? We were just getting ready to go there ourselves. Wanna lift?

Mordecai: Uh, sure. We’ll take a ride to the compound.

Jones: Come to think of it, why haven’t we seen you around the compound before...?

Rigby: We’ve just got back from a 10-year stand in the old shuttlecraft. Isn’t that right, captain Mordecai?

Mordecai: Yeah. And we’ve just transferred here. It’s our first day.

Jones: Well, welcome! We’ll be glad to show you around. Now, I hope you’re up to spend a 2.5 million dollars of taxpayers’ money, ‘cause we’re drivin’.

(They use a kind of an Apollo-like spaceship as their vehicle and simply cross the street because the compound is located right opposite of the Cheezer’s.)

Jones: Gentlemen, welcome to the compound! ('Compound' echos)

Rigby: Oh, uh, I forgot my ID in my other pants. Can you help me out, guys?

Mordecai: Oh, what? That was my ID! I told you not to lose it!

Jones: Guys, guys, calm down. You can use our IDs. (They pass the checkpoint.) Here. You, guys, might be more comfortable in these. (Passes them jackets)

Rigby: Ah, thanks. Yeah, I love these things, but Captain Mordecai might not be that into 'em. Don’t you like the uniforms in pink?

Jones: Pink?

Mordecai: I only had to borrow a pair that one time from... (Notices an employee list on the wall and quickly picks up a random name) Dr. Asinoskovich. That one time.

Jones: Ah, you know Dr. Asinoskovich? That’s funny. Because she’s right here. (Points at a woman standing with her back towards them)

Dr. Asinoskovich: (Turns around and speaks with a Russian accent) I don’t remember you.

Mordecai: Really? Uh... It was one time at that conference. You don’t remember me?

Dr. Asinoskovich: Uh... I don’t remember very much from that conference. I... have to go! (Runs away very quickly)

Jones: Wow! That was awkward. Ah, come on. We’ll give you the grand tour.

Mordecai: Dude, you should quit right now. You’re totally gonna get caught.

Rigby: Hmm, hmm. We’ll see.

(Lies by Thompson Twins is being played while the astronauts are showing Mordecai and Rigby around.)

(Mordecai and Rigby wash their hands in the bathroom.)

Rigby: Man, I don’t think you can last much longer. I think you should give it up.

Mordecai: They're not onto me.

Rigby: Then I guess it’s time that I start lying at one hundred percent. WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?!

Jones: And what tour would be complete without a stop at the pride of our compound --- the antimatter chamber. (Slaps some clerk on his back) How is she running today, Jimmy?

Jimmy: Well, actually, sir... There’ve been some problems maintaining safe levels of-

Jones: (Slaps Jimmy again, causing Jimmy to drop his clipboard right onto a green button, pushing it) That’s fate. I don’t understand a half of that these science types say.

Rigby: Oh, that’s too bad. Captain here’s an expert on it.

Jones: You’re an expert on antimatter?

Mordecai: Uh... Yeah... Uh... But not compared to how much this guy knows. (Points to Rigby)

(An alert beeper sound grows stronger.)

Rigby: (Frustrated) Uh...

Mordecai: Did you know he wrote a book on it?

Rigby: We wrote a book on it.

Mordecai: Well, you did the most of the work on it.

Rigby: But your name’s on the cover.

Mordecai: Yeah, right next yours.

Rigby: Above mine!

Jones: Jimmy, knock off that beepin’.

Jimmy: Yeah, actually, sir, I’m having trouble with-

Jones: Trouble? We-ell, these guys are experts! Can you lend a hand, fellas?

Rigby: Sure, we can. Go ahead, Captain.

Mordecai: (Approaches the control panel) Well, according to the book lieutenant Rigby wrote, you wanna turn that knob there.

(Jimmy follows the orders.)

Rigby: (Cuts in) But captain’s own research really out-dates mine. So turn that knob over there.

Mordecai: But he’s forgetting the recent discoveries he made. Flip those switches.

Rigby: Discoveries based on his studies... Hit those buttons.

Mordecai: I never said hit those buttons!

Rigby: Yeah, Jimmy, you’re not doing like Captain Mordecai said! You gotta do it like this! (Bumps over all the buttons)

(The anti-nucleus gets unstable. Pipes burst. Danger light bulbs explode.)

Mordecai: Dude, quit! You’re gonna break it!

Rigby: No, you’re gonna break it!

Major Williams: What’s all this commotion?

Jones: Major Williams? Sir! (Dusts off Mordecai and Rigby) We were just showing these new transfers around the compound, sir.

(A warning siren is heard.)

Jimmy: Captain Mordecai! Lieutenant Riggs! The antimatter is becoming unstable!

(Shows the antimatter wobbling in a mass.)

Jones: Captain Mordecai, Lieutenant Riggs. You can fix it, right?

Mordecai: Yes. Lieutenant Riggs can totally fix it.

Rigby: Not without captain’s help!

Jones: No time for modesty! (He opens the antimatter chamber door and shoves Mordecai and Rigby in there.)

Mordecai: Dude, this is all your fault.

Rigby: What? You’re the one who won’t admit that you suck at lying.

Mordecai: ‘Cause I don’t!

(The others watch Mordecai and Rigby argue through the window.)

Rigby: Why don't you give up and tell ‘em what’s going on so they can help us?

Mordecai: No, you do it.

Rigby: No way!

(The antimatter shakes even more.)

Mordecai: Arghhh!! Fine.

Jones: What’s the holdup?

Mordecai: Look. I have to tell you the truth. (Rigby nods.) I have a condition that makes me forget everything in times of extreme stress. (Rigby's mouth hangs open in shock.) Lieutenant Riggs doesn’t have that condition. He’s just an idiot.

Rigby: Hey!

Mordecai: We need you tell us what to do.

Jones: Oh, my... Jimmy, what do we do?

Jimmy: They have to penetrate the anti-nucleus with something solid!

Jones: Right! Listen up! You have one chance at this thing. You have to throw Lieutenant Riggs into the anti-nucleus.

Rigby: WHAT?!?!

Jones: It’s the only way. Captain Mordecai is too big for you to throw. You must sacrifice yourself to save thousands of lives, lieutenant!

Rigby: NO!! Don’t listen to him, Mordecai! DON’T DO IT!!!!

Jones: Do it! Throw him in! THROW HIM IN!!!

(Mordecai looks around, conflicted.)

Rigby: Please! No! No!

Jones: Throw him now! NOW!!!

Rigby: I’m sorry! I’m sorry for lying! You win, okay? I won’t lie anymore!

Mordecai: It’s too late, Rigby. I can’t let everybody die because of us. (Mordecai lifts Rigby up over his head and is about to throw him in...)

Rigby: NO!!!!

(A zip sound is heard.)

Rigby: Huh? (Sees that his jacket is unzipped)

Mordecai: You thought I was gonna throw you in? I told you I’m a better liar than you. (Holds the grilled cheese bag in his hand)

Rigby: Benson’s grilled cheese!

Mordecai: You better hope this works. Huh!

(Mordecai throws a bag with grilled cheese into the anti-nucleus. The anti-nucleus catches the bag with its energy field. Then it catches Rigby...)

Rigby: Nyahh!

Mordecai: Rigby! Ahh!

(...and Mordecai as well. It twists, rips them up, and puts them back together, then explodes. It then throws them out, knocking over the chamber door. They both look roasted enough. They groan and cough as they look up at the others.)

Rigby: We’re not astronauts.

(Cut to the Park. Barry and Jones hurl Mordecai and Rigby out of a van.)

Jones: If you ever lie about being astronauts again, YOU’RE DEAD!!!

Rigby: We saved the city, astro-

(The astronauts throw the Cheezer's bag in Rigby's face and drive away.)

(Benson is on the computer as they enter his room.)

Benson: Where have you been? I’ve been waiting all day.

(Mordecai gives Benson his Grilled Cheese Deluxe. It is totally burned.)

Benson: What the...? What happened to my sandwich?

Rigby: There were spacemen! At Cheezer’s! And the tube... we went down and... everyone wore sweatpants... even us... and then the room with the bad stuff... but... we saved the city with your sandwich!

Benson: Ugh!... Why do you always have to lie to my face?!

Mordecai: We ran it over by accident.

(Pause)

Benson: See? Was it so hard to tell the truth?

Margaret: Here're you guys, enjoy.

Rigby: (Takes a big sip from his coffee) Ah! Nothing beats drinkin' joe with my bro! Haha, right, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Huh, what? Yeeeeeaaahh. (Sighs) (Margaret then looks at Mordecai) Dude, Margaret totally just smiled at me.

Rigby: No she didn't.

Mordecai: Yes she did.

Rigby: Then why don't you ask her out?

Mordecai: Agh. It's not that easy. You wouldn't understand.

Rigby: Yeah, I wouldn't understand. Probably 'cos I'm too busy drinking joe with my bro like we came here to do in the first place, remember?

Mordecai: Shh. Wait.

(A commercial starts on the TV)

Man on TV: I once was lost, but now I'm found. (Sprays cologne, and women tears the man's clothes off) DudeTime, for men.

Rigby: Pssh. What kind of loser would want a bunch of chicks tearing their clothes off? Right, Mordecai?

(A dream sequence follows. Mordecai imagines what would happen if he bought that cologne, he sprays it on and a bunch of chicks come out, including Margaret.)

Margaret: Mordecai.

Mordecai: Oh, hey Margaret. Didn't notice you there.

Margaret: Gee Mordecai, I don't think I've ever realized how awesome you are. And you smell great too. Mordecai? Mordecai?

(Imagination sequence ends and Rigby is snapping him out of it, Margaret's voice fading into his)

Rigby: Mordecai? Mordecai?

Mordecai: Dude, I'm buying that cologne.

Rigby: Agh! Why? You said you would chip in for that awesome new game.

(A flashback occurs in where Rigby is watching a commercial with two dudes with no shirts)

John #1: I'm John.

John #2: I'm also John.

John #1 & 2: We're the Strong Johns! Strong Johns, Strong Johns! You have to buy Strong Johns! Strong Johns, Strong Johns! You gotta buy Strong Johns! (Flashback ends)

Rigby: (Sings the theme song from the commercial) Bam! Now do want that game?

Mordecai: No, I still want the cologne.

Rigby: If you buy that cologne then I'm gonna lose all respect for you.

Mordecai: Good. Then we'll both have the same amount of respect for each other.

Rigby: Ugh! What's with you? We had a plan: coffee, Strong Johns, hang out!

Mordecai: Dude, we can hang out later. I just wanna go buy some that cologne really quick.

Rigby: No, that wasn't part of the plan! If you leave, then I'm gonna have to get some new friends!

Mordecai: That's cool. I'll probably be too busy with the ladies anyway.

Rigby: Well fine. I'll be busy with my new friends! Plan-breaker!

(Mordecai leaves. In the next scene, Mordecai sits on a bench in the park and sprays on DudeTime, and is waiting for chicks, but only Rigby comes, shocking Mordecai.)

Rigby: Are you done with your stupid cologne yet? You know that stuff's not gonna work.

Mordecai: Why don't you get out of here? You don't know anything.

(Pops comes to the scene)

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, wonderful day we're hav--. (He smells something funky, which is the cologne, and he runs away squealing in horror.)

Rigby: (laughs) In your face! I knew that stuff wasn't gonna work.

Mordecai: Shut up! I'm not trying to attract Pops, I'm trying to attract Margaret. She's probably on her way right now. (Sprays more of the cologne, while Rigby is coughing, and the cologne attracts a haze.) Margaret? I'm over here. Margar--? (Spots a Unicorn behind him) Oh, geez!

1st Unicorn: (sniffs) Whaddaya got there?

Mordecai: DudeTime?

1st Unicorn: Aw, I knew it! Come out, bros, come out! I told you it was DudeTime!

(Five other Unicorns emerge from the bushes.)

4th Unicorn: Alright! DudeTime!

5th Unicorn: Yeah! DudeTime, bros!!

(The Unicorns chatter excitedly. A 7th Unicorn floats down from the sky)

7th Unicorn: Yo! Did someone say there's DudeTime down here?

1st Unicorn: Can I bum a spray, can I bum a spray?

(The unicorn grabs the DudeTime and sprays it all over his neck and face)

Mordecai: Who are these guys?

Rigby: I dunno. They seem pretty cool, though!

7th Unicorn: You bros wanna hang out?

Rigby: (gasps) I wanna hang out! But you're wasting your time with this guy. All he wants to do is get with Margaret.

1st Unicorn: Margaret? That doesn't sound like a dude's name. Are you using DudeTime to get the ladies?

Mordecai: Yeah, so what?

(The unicorns all gasp in horror)

1st Unicorn: Aw no, bro! You don't use this to get the ladies. You use it to hang out with the bros!

Unicorns: Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros! Bros!

Rigby: Yeah, hee hee! Finally somebody's speaking my language! (Rigby joins in with the chant of Bros.)

1st Unicorn: Haw haw! Little dude makes me laugh. Seriously though. You're pretty cool, too, for letting us bum some of your DudeTime, so... if you really wanna attract the ladies, we can help.

Mordecai: Really?

1st Unicorn: Aw, yeah. We know all about the ladies.

(Montage follows of 1st Unicorn getting a massage at the beach, 6th unicorn in a hot tub with five beautiful women, and 1st Unicorn being fed a bucket of something as he says, "Aw yeah, girl!")

Mordecai: Actually, uh, that would be pretty awesome, guys.

1st Unicorn: Cool. Just point us to the lady.

(The scene cuts to outside the coffee shop, where the original six unicorns are waiting with Mordecai and Rigby. Rigby is shown wearing an open dark green shirt)

Mordecai: Well, this is where she works. What do I gotta do?

1st Unicorn: Oh, we'll tell you what to do, but first you have to drink from the Cup of Knowledge.

(1st Unicorn hands a sparkling chalice filled with turquoise liquid to Mordecai, who drinks up as the Unicorns look on, grinning. Mordecai spits it out in disgust and the unicorns laugh)

Mordecai: Aw, sick. What was that?!

1st Unicorn: It's definitely not unicorn slomp! (The Unicorns high-five. The 7th Unicorn has arrived by this point)

Mordecai: How is that supposed to get me a lady?

1st Unicorn: Chill out, bro. We're just having a little fun.

Rigby: Yeah, fun! Ever hear of it?

(Mordecai punches and grabs Rigby)

Mordecai: Quit bein' such a jerk!

(The unicorns separate the two)

1st Unicorn: Come on! We won't mess with you anymore. I promise. Got a great way to help you get your lady.

Mordecai: Great. As long as I don't have to stand next to that total loser I'm up for anything.

Rigby: Meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meh meeeeeh.!

(Scene resets with everyone outside the coffee shop again)

1st Unicorn: 'Kay, check it: the ladies love dudes who slick their hair back. Jimmy, give 'im the stuff.

5th Unicorn: Here, use this!

(The 5th Unicorn, Jimmy, hands Mordecai a bottle full of a sparkling turquoise liquid.)

Mordecai: Huh, fine.

(Mordecai pours it onto his hand and slicks his hair back with it. He looks at it in the reflection on the glass window)

Mordecai: Are you sure she'll be into this?

1st Unicorn: Totally, bro, she'll be all about it. All you gotta do is lay it down.

Mordecai: Lay it... down.

1st Unicorn: Yeah, bro, you know: lay it down!

(The unicorns all chant 'lay it down' as one of them pushes Mordecai into the coffee shop. Mordecai sighs nervously and walks towards Margaret)

Margaret: Can I help you?

Mordecai: (nervously) H-hey, Margaret...

Margaret: Mordecai?

(The unicorns are seen through the window, laughing and high-fiving)

Margaret: Oh, hey! What's up?

Mordecai: I'm uh, I'm here to... lay it down.

Margaret: What?

Mordecai: Lay it... down?

Margaret: Um. Sure. Are you feeling OK?

(The unicorns and Rigby laugh from the window)

Mordecai: Yeah, I'm great, uh, I'll be right back.

(Mordecai runs outside)

Mordecai: What the H, guys? Not cool!

1st Unicorn: Chill out, bro! We were watching you in there and little dude had a really good point.

Mordecai: What point?

1st Unicorn: That we're totally not hanging out enough.

Mordecai: Aw, jeez.

1st Unicorn: Don't worry. We're still gonna help you get your lady.

Mordecai: How?

1st Unicorn: By partying at your place!

Mordecai: (screaming) Wait what?!

(Scene cuts to outside the park house at night. The lights are on and rock music is playing as a TV smashes through an upper window. Inside, we see the unicorns chugging soda and fighting in the kitchen. Rigby and Mordecai are just inside the back door, watching the carnage)

Rigby: Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

Mordecai: Dude, these guys aren't trying to help me. They're just messing with me.

Rigby: Dude, they're just partying.

Mordecai: How is this supposed to help me get the ladies?

Rigby: They got you a lady!

(We see a long-haired man with an open green shirt on a chair in the corner. He has stubble on his chin, a necklace, wristbands, blue jeans, and cowboy boots)

Mordecai: That's not a lady.

(Mordecai approaches the 1st Unicorn, who's drinking soda with the 2nd Unicorn. He puts his hand on 1st Unicorn's shoulder)

Mordecai: Hey, I thought you were gonna help me with Margaret.

1st Unicorn: (angrily) Something's touching me!

(1st Unicorn elbows Mordecai, who flies onto the floor. The unicorns laugh)

Rigby: Hey, bros, check this out. (Approaches Mordecai) Here, let me help you up. (He pulls his hand away at the last second.) Psych! Why don't you ask Margaret to help you up? Ohhhhh!

(The unicorns all laugh)

Mordecai: You know what, Rigby? Have fun with your new friends, you jerk. Oh, and just so you know, when Benson finds out about your friends and their little hangout time, he's probably gonna fire ya. Later, bro.

Rigby: (worried) Mordecai, wait!

(The door slams.)

5th Unicorn: (from upstairs) Bros! I found a trampoline!

Rigby: No! (Rigby runs up to his room) What are you doing to my bed?

5th Unicorn: You sleep on this, bro?!

Rigby: Get off it!

5th Unicorn: Right after this somersault. (The unicorn flips in mid air and his horn rips the trampoline, falling to the floor.) Bros, this trampoline's all over me. Help me get it off!

(The unicorns run in, chanting 'bros', and in a matter of seconds reduce the trampoline to torn fabric and twisted metal)

Rigby: My bed!

(1st Unicorn and 3rd Unicorn are shown by the closet door)

1st Unicorn: Hey, bro. You know this nerd?

(They open the closet door to show Benson, bound, gagged, and suspended from a coat hook. Benson rages from behind his gag, but his words are unintelligible)

Benson: Hrrgrh! Rgh! Rrrghhlllghg! Mmmmnnnggghllgh! (probably) Rigby! When I get out of here I'll kill you!

1st Unicorn: Check this out. (He gets some gumballs out of Benson and eats them) What's the matter, Rigbone? You like that nerd or something?

3rd Unicorn: (slaps Rigby) Yeah, dude. Chill out. (Elbows Rigby) And have a drink! (He sprays Rigby with a soda can, temporarily blinding Rigby. In his confusion, Rigby stumbles between the unicorns, who have formed a circle with the intention of repeatedly farting on him)

(The scene cuts to outside, where Mordecai is sitting alone on the steps as bassy music plays inside. Rigby comes out to join him, putting his arm on Mordecai's shoulder.)

Rigby: Hey, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Don't touch me!

Rigby: Heh, huh... So, I sorta need your help.

Mordecai: Why don't you ask your new bros for help?

Rigby: Dude, get over it! It's not my fault! If you would have just hung out with me and played some Strong Johns, none of this woulda happened.

Mordecai: Look, I'm sorry about the game, but that doesn't give you the right to treat me like garbage! (yells) You owe me an apology!

Rigby: (avoiding eye contact, speaking quickly and quietly) I'm sorry.

Mordecai: A real apology.

Rigby: OK, I'm sorry. I'm... sorry! (screaming) Is that what you want to hear? (screaming louder) I MISS YOU!!!! I miss you...! (Rigby looks like he's about to cry)

Mordecai: OK, quit being a baby. (He punches Rigby in the arm)

Rigby: Ahh! Why?!

Mordecai: That's for psyching me.

(Rigby grumbles, and a window smashes behind them)

Mordecai: It's gonna suck for you when Benson gets untied.

Rigby: Dude, you have to help me.

Mordecai: Way ahead of you, bro.

(The scene cuts to outside Skips' house. The garage door is open and the lights are on in the house itself. Inside, Skips is bench pressing weights while Mordecai and Rigby stand at his feet)

Mordecai and Rigby: Hey Skips.

Rigby: We have a problem.

Skips: Unicorns?

Rigby: How'd you know?

Skips: They peed on my lawn.

Mordecai: So, how do we get rid of them?

Skips: Well, that's really hard. They're like insects, but... (hefts his weights onto the bar and sits up) there's one thing unicorns never say no to. (He motions for Rigby to hand him a towel - Rigby does so and Skips wipes his face with it. We zoom in close to Skips' face) Drag racing.

(Scene cuts to the park road, where Benson, Skips, Hi Five Ghost and Muscle Man stand at the trackside. Behind a starting line are Mordecai and Rigby in a golf cart, and six of the unicorns in an oversized dragster. Pops is in front of the finish line with two checkered flags. The unicorns are chanting 'Bros'; Rigby joins in until Mordecai stops him with a raised hand and a shake of the head)

Skips: You guys know what to do, right?

Mordecai & Rigby: Yeah.

Mordecai: (loudly, so the unicorns can hear) Hey, Rigby. Weren't we supposed to race some unicorns, and not a bunch of losers?

(The unicorns shout threats and chant Bros again)

Unicorns: You're dead! You're gonna die!

Pops: Horseless carriages...

(The unicorns are still chanting Bros)

Pops: ... commence!

(The dragster takes off at lightning speed, leaving fiery trails in its wake. They are still chanting as they disappear into the distance. Mordecai and Rigby haven't moved. Skips is next to the cart with a remote control)

Skips: This is how you get rid of unicorns.

(Skips presses the red button on the remote, raising a ramp further down the road. The dragster hits the ramp and flies into mid-air. The unicorns soar through the sky, chanting Bros as they go)

Rigby: But what if they come back?

Benson: They ain't comin' back!

(Benson hits a remote control of his own, and the dragster explodes into twinkling sparkles over the city skyline)

Mordecai & Rigby: (sparkles in their eyes) Cool!

Benson: That's the only way to get rid of unicorns.

(Scene cuts to daytime, with a close-up of a hand turning a valve. Water is shown flying from a hose; it hits Mordecai, who screams in shock. Benson is hosing down Mordecai and Rigby)

Benson: I can't believe you idiots let those unicorns in here! You two morons had better get this mess cleaned up, or you'll wish it was YOU DRIVING THAT CAR!!!

Rigby: The unicorn one? (Benson sprays Rigby with the hose and Rigby screams) Coooooollld!

Benson: (to Mordecai) And you! (Mordecai screams as he shakes in fear) Quit spraying that cologne! It's not gonna get you any ladies. Idiots... (walks away)

(Rigby scampers over to Mordecai)

Mordecai: Wanna go... bro?

Rigby: Strong Johns?

Mordecai: Yeah.

Old Woman: Hello.

Master Prank Caller: Oh, yes, this is I'm a sure.

Old Woman: I'm a sure, who?

Master Prank Caller: I'm a sure glad I ain't Joe Mama! (Mordecai & Rigby both laugh at the prank call video) Oh, yeah! You just got pranked by the Master Prank Caller!

Rigby: The Master Prank Caller is the funniest thing on the internet, right, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Ye-e-eyah, I guess he's pretty funny. But you know what's even funnier than watching prank phone calls?

(Mordecai looks at the telephone)

Mordecai & Rigby: Hmm, hmm, hmm!

(Cuts to Pops' room. Pops is ironing his pants when the telephone rings.)

Pops: Hello?

Rigby: [On the phone, off-screen] Hello, Pops?

Pops: Yes?

(Mordecai and Rigby start snickering)

Rigby: [On the phone, off-screen] Please hold for a collect call from... JOE MAMA!!!

(Both Mordecai & Rigby laugh off-screen, and call Skips, who is seen lifting weights)

Skips: Hello?

Rigby: Hey, Skips, do you have a son named "Joe Mama"?

Skips: Excuse me?

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh again. Skips hangs up with an angry look.)

(Cuts to Benson's apartment. He is sitting in his easy chair when the phone rings)

Benson: Hello?

Mordecai: Hey, Benson, you got any books by "Joe Mama"?

Benson: Who is this? (Mordecai and Rigby laugh even harder than before. Mordecai lets go of the phone with Benson still talking)

Benson: [On the phone, off-screen] Wherever this is coming from, I will track you down and I will find you, and if it...!

Mordecai: Oh, dude, he's still on the phone!

Rigby: HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE?!?!?!

Mordecai: HE'S STILL ON THE PHONE! H, HA, HA, HA!!!

(Mordecai and Rigby laugh their hardest and Mordecai hangs up. Rigby's eyes begin to water)

Rigby: O-O-O-h! Oh, Mordecai, we're the best prank callers ever, aren't we?

Mordecai: Yeah, second best.

Rigby: What? Uh. Did you not hear what we just did? We were hilarious!

Mordecai: Yeah, we were. But we're not number one until we do this.

(Mordecai picks up a phone book and starts shifting through pages)

Rigby: Who are you calling? (Mordecai stops shifting through pages and points to a number on the book)

Mordecai: The Master Prank Caller.

(Mordecai takes the phone)

Rigby: Holy crap.

(Mordecai is about to dial when Benson bangs the door open off-screen.)

Benson: [off-screen] HANG UP THAT PHONE! [on-screen] You think your little pranks are funny, huh? You think they're funny? Well, what do you guys think of my prank? (walking towards the phone, he pretends to think he's being called by someone) Ring, ring. Hello, what's that? Mordecai and Rigby are banned from using the house phone? Okay.

(Suddenly, Benson's face turns red. He pulls the phone from the wall and smashes it to pieces on the floor)

Benson: GOOD LUCK MAKING YOUR PRANK CALLS NOW!

(Benson then throws the remains of the phone down and slams the door on his way out)

Mordecai: Dude, let's go use Pops' phone.

(Pops' room. Pops is still on the phone and the iron is still on his pants, which are smoking)

Mordecai and Rigby: Pops, can we borrow your phone?

Pops: Oh, I would, but I'm holding to talk with Joe Mama. (A pulse tone is heard from the phone) But you're welcome to use the phones under my bed.

(Mordecai and Rigby walk towards Pops' bed.)

Mordecai: Aw, cool! What kind are they? (Rigby pulls a case from under Pops' bed and opens it to find 80s brick-sized phones.)

Rigby: Aw, '80s cellphones!

Mordecai & Rigby: Cool. Thanks, Pops.

Pops: Oh, and boys... do be careful. I think they might cause brain tumors. (Dramatic music plays as Pops turns back to the phone and then his head starts to throb. Mordecai and Rigby exchange knowing glances.)

(Cuts to the park. Mordecai and Rigby wrap foil around their heads)

Rigby: Alright. Now let's prank the Master Prank Caller.

Mordecai: Okay, here I go. (Mordecai dials the phone and the telephone rings. The Master Prank Caller picks up to answer.)

Master Prank Caller: Hello?

Mordecai: Yeah, this is, uh, pizza delivery guy? I have 50 pizzas here that you ordered. (Mordecai and Rigby snicker)

Master Prank Caller: Sounds great. Bring 'em over.

Mordecai: Uh, you ordered 50 pizzas?

Master Prank Caller: Yeah, and hot wings. Get here quick, okay? Your mom's like totally starving.

Mordecai: Yeah, uh, okay. I gotta go. (Mordecai hangs up the phone)

Rigby: Let me take a crack at it. (Rigby dials and the telephone rings again)

Master Prank Caller: Hello?

Rigby: (Idiotic voice) Hi, this is Stan.

Master Prank Caller: Stan who?

Rigby: Uh... Stan... (Normal voice) Stanminson.

Master Prank Caller: Your name is Stan Stanminson?

Rigby: Uh... yep.

Master Prank Caller: Well, congrats. That's the stupidest fake name I've ever heard. And what happened to your unfunny fake voice?

Rigby: I don't know.

Master Prank Caller: Now listen up, stop calling here or I'm gonna make you sorry! (MPC hangs up phone)

Mordecai: Whoa, this guy's good. I don't know, maybe we shouldn't do this.

Rigby: What, you givin' up? Dude, we can prank this guy. Do you want to be this guy's son, or do you want to be number one?

Mordecai: Hmm, hmm, let's do it. (Mordecai dials the phone) Hello, Master Prank Caller, this is...

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] Did it. (MPC hangs up)

Rigby: Hmm.

(Rigby dials the phone)

Rigby: Yeah, buddy, it's Joe Ma...!

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] Heard it. (MPC hangs up)

(Mordecai dials the phone)

Mordecai: Yeah, hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] You got anything original? (MPC hangs up)

Rigby: "Yeah, hello?" Dude, that was the worst try yet.

(Rigby dials the phone)

Rigby: Time to put an end to this junk fest. Hmm.

(MPC hangs up right away)

Mordecai: Looks like the junk fest just got a new member.

Rigby: Yeah, right, like your "50 pizzas" thing was way better.

Mordecai: Whatever Stan Manastan, man. (Laughs)

(Phone suddenly rings)

Mordecai: Pff, nice try, dude. I know it's you.

Rigby: Uh... not me, dude.

(Mordecai picks up and both listen)

Mordecai: Hello?

(The Master Prank Caller's feet are seen. He is in the bathtub)

Master Prank Caller: Is this the pizza guy or Stan Stanminson?

Mordecai: Uh... both?

Master Prank Caller: [on-screen] I warned you to leave me alone. Now I'm gonna prank you so hard, you're both gonna poop a duke. [off-screen] The 1980's called: they want their cell phones back!

(Mordecai and Rigby are sucked into the phone and are sent tumbling through cables in space, with year numbers floating around them)

Mordecai and Rigby: AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

(The two are sent to another spot in the Park after they get spit out of a portal)

Rigby: Where are we?

Mordecai: Dude, I think we're back at the park.

Rigby: Are we?

Mordecai: What do you mean?

Rigby: (eyeing the spots) Dude, all the trees are small, and look at that park bench, it's so new looking. I'm telling you, something weird's going on.

Mordecai: Look, there's Pops. Let's go ask him. (Pops is facing away from the duo, working on planting a tree) Pops! Hey, Pops, can you tell Rigby here that everything is fine?

(Pops turns around, looking and sounding much younger than normal, as well as lacking a mustache)

Pops: What now?

(Mordecai and Rigby both gasp)

Mordecai: Why does Pops look so young?

Pops: Now then, who are you two gentlemen? How do you know my name?

Mordecai: Pops, It's us, Mordecai and Rigby.

Pops: But I've never met either of you gentlemen in my entire life.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: I'm telling you, dude, something weird's going on.

(M&R see a few B-Boys dancing)

Rigby: Hey, guys!

B-Boy 1: What?

Rigby: You notice anything strange going on around here?

B-Boy 1: Is he getting fresh with us?

B-Boy 2: Yo, I think he's up in our threads, homefry.

B-Boy 1: That dillweed just barfed me out.

(B-Boys walks away)

Rigby: Fresh? Barf me out? Homefries? We're in the '80s, dude! Pops, what year is this?

Pops: Well, it's 1982, of course.

Rigby: See?

Mordecai: Dude, this is bad.

Rigby: I know, I don't even like the '80s that much!

Mordecai: The only way we're gonna get back is that we prank him harder than he pranked us.

Rigby: Let's do it.

(Mordecai dials the phone)

Master Prank Caller: Hello?

Mordecai: The '60s called, they want...

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] What did I tell you about calling me?! (A yellow, sparkling cloud begins to shoot out of the top of the phone, shocking Mordecai and Rigby)

Rigby: Hang up! Hang up!

Mordecai: I can't! (Mordecai drops the phone)

(A giant '80s cell phone morphs out of the cloud. It's the Master Prank Caller)

Master Prank Caller: You couldn't leave me alone. Now you're gonna pay! (MPC dials on himself)

Mordecai: We should get out of here.

Rigby: The cart!

(Mordecai and Rigby drive away in the golf cart. The Master Prank Caller follows them, dialling again. In the cart, the phone rings and Rigby picks up)

Rigby: Hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] The '80s called. They still want ya!

(80s clothes appear on Mordecai and Rigby. They gasp, the Master Prank Caller laughs, and Rigby hangs up)

Mordecai: Aw, man, these aren't even the cool clothes from the '80s!

(Phone rings again and Rigby picks up)

Rigby: Listen, just leave us alone, will you?!

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] Don't you ever hang up on me!

(More clothes from the '80s appear on Mordecai and Rigby. Mordecai waves his arm and screams at a golden bracelet on his arm that reads 'Dawn')

Mordecai: Dude, you have to call somebody to help us prank this guy!

Rigby: Who?!

Mordecai: Just call somebody!

(The scene cuts back to the present time at the park. The other 80s cell phone rings. Pops picks it up)

Pops: Ooh, telephone. Hello?

Rigby: Pops, you gotta help us; we're stuck in the '80s!

Benson: Who are you talking to?

Pops: Why it's Mordecai and Rigby. They're stuck in the 1980's.

Benson: Oh, really?

(Benson takes the phone away from Pops and begins talking, sarcastically)

Benson: Hello?

Mordecai: Benson, you have got to help us! We're stuck in 1982!

Benson: Oh, wow. That's really something, Mordecai.

Mordecai: Crap! He thinks we're pranking him!

Rigby: What? Give me that!

(Rigby shouts down the phone)

Rigby: The '80s [off-screen] called, they want their cell phones back!

(Pops, Benson and also Skips are sucked into the phone and are sent to 1982 through phone space, landing on the back of the golf cart)

Benson: What happened?

Mordecai: We need your help to prank the Master Prank Caller.

Benson: Who?

Skips: Why did you prank him?

(Phone rings and Benson picks up this time)

Benson: I'll take care of this. Hello?

Master Prank Caller: Nice ride, but I like mine better.

(MPC summons a limo, which he is driving beside the golf cart)

Master Prank Caller: Blargh!

(The park workers scream and the Master Prank Caller tries to ram them off the road)

Skips: Forget the phone, hold the wheel steady.

(Skips jumps onto the Master Prank Caller's limo. He tears the hood ornament from the back, jumps to the front of the limo and smashes it onto the engine. Skips jumps back to the golf cart as the Master Prank Caller's limo flips several times. The Master Prank Caller escapes from his crashed car and begins to dial himself, causing the phone in the cart to ring again)

Mordecai: Don't answer it, don't answer!

Skips: Mordecai, look out!

(Mordecai runs over younger Pops, who is crossing the street with one of the phones)

Rigby: Dude, we just hit past Pops!

(Pops rises, moans briefly, and lets out a manic laugh, much like his present self)

(Mordecai, Rigby, Benson, Pops, and Skips crash into the '80s Electronic Store, where they come to rest next to a counter full of answering machines)

Clerk: Uh, can I help you with anything?

Mordecai: Dude, I got an idea.

(The scene cuts back to the park where the characters a running to the field getting ready to hide)

Mordecai: Quick, get to the field! Everybody hide! (The answering machine trap is deployed) Over there!

(Mordecai and Rigby put down the phone attached to a tape recorder and then hide in the bushes)

Mordecai: Man, I hope this works.

Rigby: It will, Mordecai. It has to.

(The phone rings. The tape recorder turns on with a recording of Mordecai's voice)

Voice of Mordecai: Hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] This is The Master Prank Caller telling you--

Voice of Mordecai: Hello?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] I said this is The Master Prank--

Voice of Mordecai: Hello? uh.. I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] I said this is The Master Prank Caller!

Voice of Mordecai: Hello, hello, are you there?

Master Prank Caller: [off-screen] RRRRGH! (The Master Prank Caller appears next to the phone and tape recorder) I SAID-- (Realizes that the voice is coming from a recorder - he's been psyched)

Voice of Mordecai: Ha ha! Just kidding. You just got pranked, loser! (Recording stops)

Master Prank Caller: NOOOOOOOOO!!!

Mordecai: Now! (Mordecai, Rigby, Skips, Pops and Benson jump out of the bushes and make a dog pile on the Master Prank Caller, holding him down)

Mordecai: Now, Rigby, hit the power button!

Rigby: Who's the best prank caller now, jerk-dish?! (Rigby climbs up the phone and hits the power button)

Master Prank Caller: No! No! NOOOOOOO- (Shut down, the MPC falls to the ground and makes no movement Mordecai and Rigby laugh)

Mordecai and Rigby: In your face! Who's the master prank caller now, you loser?

(They they laugh again, a light shines out from the MPC's speaker. Mordecai and Rigby look in)

Mordecai: Guys, this is it; it's the way back! Come on!

(The park workers appear in a hallway with doors that each have a different year on them)

Mordecai: One of these doors leads us back to the present.

(Benson then spots the present door)

Benson: There it is.

(Benson, Skips, and Pops walk through the door, but as Mordecai and Rigby are about to go through, they see the Master Prank Caller)

Master Prank Caller: Wait. (MPC's speaker breaks, revealing his true identity - a thin, undead-looking man) You guys were better than me today, but you can't leave me here. All I ever wanted to do was make prank calls like you. Was that so wrong? (The Master Prank Caller splutters and moans. Mordecai and Rigby look at each other)

(Cuts to Benson's apartment where he receives a call)

Benson: Hello?

Mordecai, Rigby and the Master Prank Caller: (To each other off-screen) 1, 2, 3. (Into the phone off-screen) The '70s called: they want their chair back!

Rigby: (Laughing) Dude! I'm open, I'm open, dude!

Mordecai: (Snickers) Go long, dude!

(Throws a ball of socks at Rigby, sending him backwards off the couch.)

Rigby: Touchdown, sock faces!

(He throws down the socks and starts imitating cheering. Right then, Benson enters.)

Benson: Hey, you two! Quit fooling around; we're having an emergency meeting.

Mordecai: Aw, what?

Rigby: Boooo.

Benson: (Signals to the door) Outside, now!

(He leaves as Mordecai and Rigby watch. A Clock transition to outside Skips's place occur. All the park workers are standing outside.)

Benson: Alright, everyone. I got some bad news. The park is being audited. (Points to Pops) Pops tried to pay the park taxes... (Gives him a look) ...with lollipops.

(The workers voice their displeasure.)

Pops: But I gave them more than enough.

Benson: We already went over this, Pops. You pay taxes with money, not lollipops.

Pops: (Sad) Oh.

Rigby: (Spits) What's the big deal? It's not like an audit is a bad thing.

Benson: It is a bad thing, Rigby. If we don't take care of this, the government takes our stuff away.

(The rest of the workers panic.)

Benson (continued): Okay, we only have till three to stop the audit.

(Slowly pan over to Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost, who are thinking up something funny.)

Benson (continued): Does anyone know someone who can help us? Anybody? Anybody at all?

Muscle Man: (Raises hand) I know someone who can help.

Benson: If you say your mom, you're fired.

Muscle Man: (Long pause) MY MOM!

Benson: GET OUT!

Muscle Man: It was worth it!

(Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost hi five and run off.)

Mordecai: (Thinks) Hmmm... Hmph. Hey! (Looks at Rigby) We know someone.

Rigby: We do?

(Mordecai raises his arms. Suddenly, Rigby knows who Mordecai is referring to.)

Rigby (continued): No! No way!

Benson: What? If you know somebody, you've got to tell me.

Mordecai: Rigby has a brother. (Rigby punches Mordecai.) And he's an accountant. (Rigby punches Mordecai rapidly.)

Rigby: Shut up!

Mordecai: Dude, what do you have against Don?

(Rigby gets mad, on the verge of crying. A ripple leads us to a flashback of Rigby's sixth birthday party. We pan down from the banner to a young Rigby.)

Young Rigby: Guys! Guys! Guys!

(Zoom out to reveal four bored children, one of them a young Mordecai)

Young Rigby (continued): Watch me blow out the candles, guys!

(A door opens. Rigby's younger brother, Don, stands in the doorway. Somehow, he is taller than Rigby.)

Young Don: Hey, Rigby. Happy birthday, bro.

(Rigby gets mad.)

Young Rigby: Wha? Wha? I told you to stay in the basement!

Young Don: Oh. Sorry, Rigby. I just wanted to give you some birthday sugar.

Young Rigby: I don't want your freakin’ sugar!

Rigby Friend 1: I'll give you some sugar, Don.

Rigby Friend 2: Yeah, me too.

(Everyone but Mordecai gets up out of their seats to hug Don. Then, Mordecai follows, but Rigby tries to stop him by grabbing his arm.)

Young Rigby: Don't you dare!

Young Mordecai: I'm just getting some sugar, dude. (Rigby lets go of him.) Besides, Don is cool.

(Mordecai goes to Don to give him sugar as everyone else laughs.)

Rigby Friend: You're the best, Don!

(Young Rigby growls as we ripple back to present day.)

Mordecai: Yeah. Don really made that party.

Benson: Call your brother!

Rigby: No!

Benson: Call your brother!

Rigby: No! I hate him!

Benson: Fine. (To Mordecai) Mordecai, you call him.

Rigby: You better not!

Mordecai: Dude, he could save the park!

Rigby: Dude, he could ruin my life! If he comes, I'm gonna tell him to leave!

Benson: (Walks up to Rigby) No, you won't! You be nice to your brother or you're FIRED! (To Mordecai) Call him. (He walks off.)

Mordecai: (Pats Rigby) Dude, just be cool until he stops the audit.

Rigby: Grrrr!

(Scene shows the park workers outside waiting for Don.)

Rigby: You guys are making a big mistake.

Benson: Don't ruin this for us, Rigby.

(We see Don drive up in his convertible.)

Benson: Really nice car.

Pops: He looks just like Rigby.

Don: (Gets out of his car) Did somebody order an accountant?

(Everybody laughs except Rigby.)

Benson: Thank you so much for coming on such short notice. I'm Benson.

Don: Benson. Give me some sugar. (Hugs Benson) Nice to meet you. Hey, who's this guy?

Pops: I'm Pops.

Don: Pops. Give me some sugar.

(Pops runs over laughing and gives Don a big hug.)

Don: Don. Good to meet ya.

(Don hugs Skips.)

Don: Look at this sugar shack. Come here, guy (Gives Mordecai a hug) I haven't seen you in forever.

Mordecai: (Chuckles) Yeah, I know! Oh, it's been forever.

Don: Rigby. Give me some sugar, bro.

Rigby: Don't you have taxis to do? Why don't you get to it?

Don: (Chuckles) Oh. He was always greedy with the sugar.

Rigby: Augh! I can't wait for you to get out of my life!

Don: What, bro?

Benson: (Angrily whispers to Rigby) You keep your mouth shut!

Rigby: (flinching) Nothing.

(The scene switches to Rigby in the hallway. Don and the others can be heard through a doorway in the computer room.)

Don: So then I said, "you're not an accountant, you're an account-can't!"

(The others laugh at the joke.)

Pops: I didn't realize accounting could be so fascinating!

Don: I'm just lucky I get do what I love.

Rigby: (Mocking Don) "Ohh, I'm just lucky I get to do what I love."

Don:  (Turns around) Rigbone. Sugar?

Rigby: Shouldn't you be fixing the augite?

Don: You mean the audit?

Rigby: Don't correct me! I know what it is!

Don: (Laughing) Whoa, there. I'm sensing some tension, bro. I think it's time we all take a well-deserved break.

(The gang - minus Rigby - are outside, and they are playing football.)

Don: Mordo! Go long!

(He then throws the ball too far.)

Mordecai: I got it!

(He goes to find the ball and sees Rigby already holding it. A mad expression is evident on his face.)

Rigby: Hello, "Mordo". Enjoying your game?

Mordecai: Uh, sure, dude. Can you pass the ball?

(Rigby throws the ball hard at Mordecai's stomach.)

Mordecai: (Grunts) Rigby!

Rigby: He's not even doing the debit!

Mordecai: It's audit! (Sighs) Rigby, why don't you just try being nice to your brother? He's actually pretty cool.

Rigby: You don't get it! He...

Don: Hey, Mordo! We playing or what?

Mordecai: Uh, yeah, coming!

(Mordecai runs off, leaving Rigby looking just as angry as before.)

(Back inside, Don is alone at the computer.)

Don: Ah, I just about got this. With a few minutes to spare. (Rigby walks in.) Rigbone. How about a little pre-saving the park sugar? You know: for almost being done saving the park?

Rigby: NO!

Don: What's going on with us? You never give me some sugar. Did I do something?

Rigby: Yeah. You were born!

Don: Wow. That's heavy. I gotta get out of here.

(Don leaves the room.)

Mordecai: Dude? No, wait Don!

Don: I'm sorry. I just... gotta get out of here!

Mordecai: Dude, what are you doing? He was almost done!

Rigby: Ah, he's not so cool.

(Runs from the hallway to the computer.)

Rigby (continued): I can finish this up myself.

(Rigby presses a button on keyboard. A bunch of ads and warnings appear on screen as the computer beeps and rattles.)

Rigby: OK. (He presses another button and more ads pop up. The screen turns red and vibrates dangerously.) Augh! Mordecai! Help!

Mordecai: What did you do?

Rigby: I don't know!

Mordecai: This doesn't make any sense.

Rigby: No, no, no!

(Benson knocks on the door)

Benson: Don? We brought you a cake. It's almost three. Were you able to stop the audit?

Rigby: (Imitates Don, badly) Uh, almost done, Benson-bone. (Normal voice, to Mordecai) How do I send this thing?

Mordecai: No dude, call your brother back.

Rigby: No! I hate him!

(Rigby tries to push send on the keyboard, but Mordecai pushes him away. The two battle on the floor.)

Mordecai: Don't... Don't send it! Don't!

Rigby: Augh! Must... push... send!

(Rigby fights his way up to the keyboard and pushes send. The computer beeps quickly and the clock strikes. It shows a time of 3:05.)

Mordecai & Rigby: Crap!

Computer: You are late. Begin audit.

(The computer shows an 'AUDIT IN PROGRESS' status bar counting up. The computer shakes so much it causes the whole room to vibrate. The clock, lamp, and eventually half the furniture are engulfed in black and white binary code, which causes the items to disappear. The door also disappears, surprising Benson. The cake and Pops's hat are the next objects affected.)

Pops: Oh, my...

Benson: Where's Don? (Outside, Don is shown driving away, almost crying. The others run out after him.) Don! Wait! (To the others) What happened?

Mordecai: Rigby blew it! He wouldn't give Don sugar.

Benson: (Furious) What?! Go give him some sugar!

Rigby: (Even more furious) NEVER!

(Rigby runs away, panting. Inside, we see Mordecai and Rigby's room. It is slowly being eaten by the binary code. Mordecai enters.)

Mordecai: Rigby? Rigby! (He looks for Rigby and eventually sees his tail poking out from under a pile of clothes on his trampoline.) Rigby!

Rigby: (In a sad voice) Rigby's not here right now.

Mordecai: Quit being so selfish! (Moves clothing out of the way) The park is disappearing! We have to end this.

Rigby: Don't tell me what to do! You don't know what it's like to have a brother, so you don't know!

Mordecai: You're right. I don't have a brother. But I kinda know what it's like... 'cause I have you, dude. You're like my brother.

Rigby: (Climbing out from under a t-shirt) Really?

Mordecai: Yeah. You're to me like Don is to you. I think you're kinda awkward to look at, and you embarrass me all the time, and I wish I could trade you in for someone else. But I don't. Because you're like my brother. With brothers you always gotta make do. And I think you should make do, too.

(We see the binary code continuing to eat up the room.)

Mordecai (continued): Now will you please get Don to stop this audit?

(We see the exterior of Don's house, which is huge and modern. Mordecai and Rigby are talking to Don, who has answered his front door.)

Don: Look, I'm glad you guys stopped by but... I just can't finish the audit. I'm sorry.

(Don tries to go back inside, but Rigby grabs the door before he can close it)

Rigby: Don, please! I need your help with the audit, bro.

Don: Why is it so hard for you to give me sugar? (Almost crying) Why do you hate me?

Mordecai: He's mad about the birthday party.

Rigby: No! It wasn't just the birthday party. It's everything.

(He looks up at a photo of Don and Rigby, in which Rigby is literally in Don's shadow.)

Rigby (continued): I'm always in your shadow. You're so much better than me. Everyone likes you better, (Almost crying) and to top it all off, everyone thinks you're my older brother. I'm the older brother! Me! Why do all my friends think you're so much cooler than me?

(Don gasps and slaps his cheeks. A montage with sad music follows. He looks up at a photo of his younger self playing on a playground merry-go-round with Mordecai and Rigby's other friends, while Rigby sits alone on a seesaw. Then a three-legged race is shown, but Rigby isn't tied to anyone, so he remains alone at the starting line. Finally, Mordecai and Rigby are in a photo booth: Rigby looks angry as Mordecai beckons Don in as well. Photos are shown in which Mordecai and Don are front and center, and Rigby struggles to be seen at the back. The montage ends.)

Don: I... I had no idea. I'm sorry, bro. I didn't mean to steal your friends. I was just trying to be cool like you.

Rigby: Huh?

Don: I've always looked up to you, bro. I get my hair cut like you, I try to look like you, and I don't wear clothes, just like you. Remember when you started walking around naked? I thought you were so cool.

Mordecai: Yeah, dude. That was pretty cool.

(Don looks out the window and sees the park being engulfed by the binary code.)

Don: Alright. Let's go save your park.

(Don, Mordecai, and Rigby drive back to the park, which is being eaten to the point of oblivion by the audit. Inside, they see Pops, Skips and Benson hanging from the rapidly-disintegrating house.)

Don: Where's the computer?

(Mordecai points upstairs. Don runs up and sits at the desk.)

Don: Jeez! What did you do, bro?

Rigby: I tried to do the taxis!

Don: Hold on. This is gonna be close.

(Don works on the taxes as the others gather behind him. Sweat forms on his face and he bites his lip.)

Don: Alright, I got it! I just have to do one more thing.

Mordecai & Rigby: Do it!

(Some moments of silence follow and the workers look around.)

Rigby: Why isn't anything happening?

Don: Because... (Stands up and turns around, arms outstretched) I still need some sugar, bro.

Rigby: WHAT?

Everyone except Rigby: (Angrily) Rigby!

(As the music swells, Rigby, in slow-motion, jumps through space on the scattered household items to his brother, who catches him. The screen turns white and we see everyone outside, the house and park back to normal.)

Mordecai: Aw, Don. Do you have to leave already?

Don: Sorry, Mordo, but an accountant's work is never done.

Benson: Thanks for everything, Don.

Pops: Do come back soon!

Skips: Mmhmm.

Don: Well, big brother, if you ever need some sugar, you know who to call.

(Rigby smiles. Don gets in his car.)

Don: Later, gators.

(Don drives off)

Mordecai: (Leaning in to Rigby with a giant smirk on his face) Sugar?

Rigby: Shut up!

Mordecai: Augh, this sucks.

Rigby: What's that supposed to mean?

Mordecai: It means that the next time we get to pick our job for the day, I get to pick. Why did you pick the Snack Bar?! This is like the worst job at the park, dude!

Rigby: I think it's the funniest job at the park.

Mordecai: You don't really think that. You just don't want to admit that you're wrong.

Rigby: Why would I admit something that I'm not?

Mordecai: Dude, seriously, this is more boring than watching you trying to read a children's book.

Rigby: Is it more boring than your face?

Mordecai: I don't know. Is it more boring than my fist in your face?

Rigby: Is it more boring than my fist in your face, You turd?!

Mordecai: You're a turd!

Rigby: No, you're a turd!

Mordecai & Rigby: (Starts fighting) You're the turd!

(Pops appears)

Pops: Mordecai, Rigby, stop! We can all be turds.

Mordecai & Rigby: (Start dusting themselves off) Oh, hey, Pops.

Pops: So, how do you like being the guardians of the snacks?

Rigby: It's awesome.

Mordecai: This place is lame.

(Mordecai and Rigby start fighting again)

Pops: But, Mordecai, don't you like eating snacks for free?

Mordecai: What?

Pops: When I work here, all the snacks are free! Ta ta. (Walks away)

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other for a moment, then duck down under the counter, shoveling doughnuts into their mouths.)

Rigby: I guess this means I was right about the Snack Bar.

Mordecai: Yeaa-uhh!

(A montage begins of Mordecai and Rigby eating a variety of snacks. At the end, the Snack Bar is a mess, and Mordecai and Rigby are sick from overeating.)

Mordecai: I need to eat something healthy, like a salad or something.

Rigby: What? Are you kidding? Dude, all these snacks are free, dude. (Stops himself from vomiting) Trust me. If we keep eating, we'll feel better in no time.

Mordecai: Oh, if we eat more, we'll feel better? Dude, quit being a loser.

Rigby: Loser?! I don't know that I want to listen to the guy who was wrong about the Snack Bar being cool. No, I think I'd rather listen to the guy who's right all the time. ME. (Holds up a fried soda cup and takes a bite out of it)

Mordecai: Augh! Sick!

Rigby: Hmm. Hmm. (Grimaces in pain as his stomach rumbles)

(Clock transition to the house. It is nighttime. The scene changes to inside the house, where Mordecai is eating a salad.)

Mordecai: (Takes a bite of the salad) Ahh. I feel so much better.

Rigby: (Who is next to a blender with a doughnut, candy, and other junk food inside) So do I. (He starts the blender, grinding all the junk food into goop. He then proceeds to drink it, grimacing in pain again as his stomach rumbles.)

Mordecai: Dude, I'm telling you. If you keep eating like that, your body's gonna quit on you.

Rigby: Stop talking!

Mordecai: Whatever. I'm just trying to help. (Walks out of the kitchen)

Rigby: Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. I showed him. (Puts another doughnut in his mouth. A split second later, Rigby is rolling on the floor, groaning in pain) Why isn't more food working...? (Screams in pain, then picks up the doughnut next to him) One more should do it... (He suddenly drops the doughnut as he loses control of his hands) Huh? (Rigby's hands grab his face, pull him to his feet, and drag him around the room. He smashes into a wall, then falls over the fallen chair. His hands then pull really hard, causing his eyes to roll back into his head and glow) What are you doing?! (His hands keep pulling, eventually ejecting Rigby as a green glob of consciousness with Rigby's eyes.)

Rigby: Aww, let me back in! (His body pushes him away and runs off) Wait! Come back! (Tries to follow his body, but ends up inside a bucket on the floor) Ohhh... Whatever. I'm just gonna chill in this bucket.

(Clock transition to the next day. Mordecai enters the kitchen.)

Rigby: (Calling from the bucket) Mordecai! Mordecai!

Mordecai: (Sees Rigby as the green glob) Aww, SICK! What the heck is that?!

Rigby: Ha ha! Who's the loser now, Mordecai?

Mordecai: Wait... Rigby?

Rigby: Dude, in your face! I was right! My stomach doesn't even hurt anymore.

Mordecai: That's because you don't even have a BODY anymore! Dude, this is bad.

Rigby: Yeah, bad like good! Now shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole!

Mordecai: (Sighs, picks up the bucket) You better hope Skips knows how to fix this.

(Clockwise wipe to Skips' House)

Skips: What happened to his body?

Mordecai: Dude, I don't know. It like, ditched him or something from eating too much junk food.

Skips: Well, it looks like it's not that big of a deal, if he doesn't mind being a bodiless consciousness for the rest of his life.

Rigby: It's cool, I don't mind.

Mordecai: What?! No! Dude, quit being a loser.

Rigby: Since when does being right make you a--

Mordecai: (Puts a lid on the bucket and sighs) Skips, what do we have to do? I can't let him stay like this.

Skips: That's a bit tougher. Once the body departs, you only have till sunset to get it back. You know where it is?

Mordecai: No.

Skips: Hmm, then we have to find it. Let's go.

Mordecai: (Walking out the door with Skips) We'll be right back, Rigby. Just stay here.

(Mordecai and Skips drive away with the cart, leaving Rigby, who is stuck in the bucket, alone.)

Rigby: What? Where ya goin'? At least shovel some cheese curls into my trash hole. Guys? Guys?

(Clockwise wipe to the park; Rigby's body lays the salad down, looks both ways to make sure no one sees him, and starts eating. Cut to Skips' house.)

Rigby: (Moving the bucket with all his might, although bodiless; grunting) Ergghh!! Phew! I guess it is kinda harder to move around without my body. (Rigby then sees the hockey stick and roller skates, then comes up with an idea to move around easier)

(Clockwise wipe back to the park; Mordecai and Skips sneak behind a bush as they hear Rigby's body chewing salad)

Skips: Shh. (Parts the bushes)

Mordecai: (Whispering) What's it doing?

Skips: Eating a salad. Rush him on the count of three.

Mordecai: Okay.

Skips: One....two....

(Rigby wheels in with his new way of moving when bodiless. The tape from the hockey stick is strapped to the roller skates and his bucket.)

Rigby: (Loudly) Hey, guys! What's up?

(Rigby's body, hearing this, stops eating the salad and runs away.)

Mordecai and Skips: No!

Skips: (Points at Rigby) We told you to stay put! (Walks away)

Mordecai: Ugh! Rigby, you scared it away!

Rigby: Oh, don't worry about that! Remember how I said I don't need it? Well, I was right again! Dude, check it! (Wheels around as Mordecai watches in horror) It's a trash can and a roller blade.

Mordecai: I can't believe you! Please, just stay put! (Walks away)

Rigby: Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm. All this being right is making me hungry.

(At the Snack Bar, Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost are behind the counter, where Mordecai and Rigby were at the beginning of the episode)

Muscle Man: This, Sucks! Wait, what is that? (Sees Rigby in the bucket, skating to the Snack Bar)

Rigby: (Slams the Snack Bar door open) Gimme some snacks!

Hi Five Ghost: (Scared) What are you?

Muscle Man: Looks like a bucket of diarrhea.

Rigby: It's me, Rigby!

Muscle Man: (Terrified) Oh, man! That boot with wheels stole Rigby's voice!

Rigby: No, I didn't steal anything.

Muscle Man: You're not stealing these voices. C'mon Fives, let's bail! (They climb out of the Snack Bar and run off)

Rigby: Come back!

Muscle Man: No way, bro!

Rigby: It's me, Rigby! (Trips on a rock) Aw, man.

(Clockwise wipe to the park. Skips picks up the eaten salad.)

Skips: (Sniffs the salad) He's close. I'll take care of the body. You go find Rigby. We don't have much time.

(The sun is shown over the building as Mordecai is looking for Rigby at the Snack Bar)

Mordecai: Rigby! Rigby! Where is he?

(Walks out of the Snack Bar. Muscle Man and Hi Five Ghost walk up to him, armed with weapons; Muscle Man is carrying a bat and Hi Five Ghost is wearing a brass knuckle)

Mordecai: Hey, have you guys seen Rigby?

Muscle Man: No. Have you seen a magic garbage can? We need to beat the living-

Mordecai: Magic garbage can? That was Rigby! Which way did he go?

(Rigby is heard screaming; a few feet away, a trash collector is dumping Rigby into a garbage truck. He throws the skate-can back onto the ground)

Mordecai: (Gasps) Rigby!

(The truck pulls away with Rigby still inside. We see Rigby in the filthy, roach-infested truck, recoiling and squealing in horror)

Rigby: Help!

Bodybuilder: No-one can hear you.

Rigby: Who's there?

Bodybuilder: Don't worry: just another bodiless consciousness. (Admires Rigby and rolls around him, talking) Woah! Hey, did you work out way too hard, too?

Rigby: N-no. I ate too much junk food.

Bodybuilder: Yep, that'll do it. Me? I was a bodybuilder. (We see a flashback of a huge, muscular man lifting weights at a gym) I could have gone pro. My friend kept telling me, (a pink blob morphs out of the basketball and starts speaking in angry, mocking tones) "If you keep pumpin' iron like that, your body's gonna quit on you!" I told him he was full of it! (Morphs back into the basketball) But I didn't get my bod' back in time and now look at me: stuck with a basketball for a body.

Rigby: Yeah, well, my body's still good.

(The blob pops back out of the basketball for a second)

Bodybuilder: Wait, your body's still good? Well, whatcha doin' in here, dummy?

Rigby: I...

Bodybuilder: You must not want it. Mind if I take it?

Rigby: No!

(The basketball bounces away)

Bodybuilder: Don't worry, I'll find it. So long, sucka!

Rigby: (Anguished) No!!! (Falls over, crying, but looks over to see the trash door open and Mordecai appear) Mordecai! You were right and I was wrong! (Still crying) I'm sorry for being such a loser. (Pitifully whining in a high voice) Please help me get my body back...!

Mordecai: Don't worry, dude. I think we can get it back in time. And even if we mess up, you've always got this! (Holds up the skate-can)

Mordecai and Rigby: Ohhhhh!!!

Rigby: But seriously, dude, I want my old body back.

Mordecai: (Into two-way radio) Skips, I found Rigby.

Skips: (Through radio) I found the body, but you'd better hurry. We got a problem.

(Rigby looks worried. The scene cuts to the park, where Rigby's body, clad in a bodybuilding outfit, is limbering up in preparation to lift a dumbbell. He tries to lift, but immediately drops the weight. The bodybuilder's essence morphs out of Rigby's body and addresses him angrily)

Bodybuilder: Body, you're worthless! (Slaps the body) I can't believe you can't do a simple clean and jerk!

(Mordecai and Skips are shown behind Rigby's body. Mordecai is holding up the trash can with Rigby in it)

Rigby: Hey! What are you doin' with my body?!

Bodybuilder: Oh, it's you! (Morphs back into Rigby's body) What do you think? Pretty cool, huh?

Rigby: No, not pretty cool. You dress me like a loser!

Bodybuilder: (Flexes grossly) Aw, you don't like weightlifting singlets? No wonder your body left you. Oh well. Now it's not you anymore... (Flexes again) It's me.

Rigby: Augh! Gimme back my body!

Bodybuilder: Finders keepers.

Mordecai: Skips!

Skips: We tried it the nice way. Now we do it the Skips way.

(Skips' nipples glitter and thump. The bodybuilder looks nervous for a second, then throws his singlet towards Mordecai and runs off)

Bodybuilder: So long, suckers!

(Mordecai, Rigby and Skips chase the bodybuilder through the park. The bodybuilder sprints ahead onto the road, knocking over a cyclist in his haste.)

Skips: He's too fast.

(Pops pulls alongside in a golf cart)

Pops: Are you having a game of tag, turds?

Skips: I really wish you wouldn't teach him those words.

(Skips and Mordecai jump into the cart, with Rigby in hand. Skips takes the wheel)

Skips: Pops, slide over.

(The chase continues up and down the park hill)

Rigby: I'll take it from here!

(Rigby dives from the cart before Mordecai can grab him)

Mordecai: Rigby! No!

(Rigby and his body are seen tumbling down the side of the switchback road as the cart continues on the pavement)

Skips: It's too steep. We'll have to go around.

(Further down the road, Rigby and his body emerge from the bushes, still fighting)

Rigby: Give me my body back!

Bodybuilder: No! Get off me!

(Rigby manages to crawl back into his body.)

Rigby: Get outta my body!

(The two essences pop out of Rigby's chest and continue to wrestle)

Bodybuilder: No: you get outta the body, you worm!

(The bodybuilder's essence throws Rigby's essence at the cart, hitting Skips on the face. Skips swerves the cart and blindly runs into Rigby's body, sending the bodybuilder's essence flying to a nearby playground, where he lands on a slide and becomes one with it. A fat kid slides down and is seen walking away from the slide)

Bodybuilder: Aw, man, my mouth was open!

(Back at the cart, the four park workers look at Rigby's body on the road. It has a tire track right across its back)

Rigby: Dude, we did it! I got my body back!

Mordecai: (Moans in disgust) Are you sure you still want it?

(We zoom in on the body and see it even more mangled, with flies buzzing around it. Rigby picks up the body and its arms hang limp and broken)

Rigby: I'll never treat you like that again.

Skips: Quick! Before the sun sets.

(As Rigby watches the sun set, he dives into his body, which shoots out white light in beautiful rays)

Pops: (Eyes wide in wonder) Glorious.

(The white light stops, and Rigby's eyes roll forward in his head. He blinks in recognition. Mordecai leans over him and puts a hand on his belly)

Mordecai: Dude. How do you feel?

Rigby: (Screaming)

(Cuts to the interior of the Snack Bar, where Rigby is wrapped almost entirely in plaster, sitting on a wheelchair, with bleary eyes)

Rigby: Well Mordecai, I guess you were right about the Snack Bar being lame. Especially now that we're not into eating all the free snacks.

Mordecai: Oh, about that. Those snacks weren't free.

Rigby: What?

Mordecai: Turns out only Pops gets snacks for free.

Rigby: (Pitiful whine) Pops?

Mordecai: Yeah. And I guess we're supposed to work here for the next six months just to pay for it all.

Rigby: Ohhh... turds.

Rigby: Dude! Check it out, man! They're here!

Mordecai: What's here?

Rigby: Our fake band t-Shirts that we ordered from that site last night.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Last night, I asked you if you wanted to be in a band and you said...

(A flashback of the previous night shows Mordecai and Rigby pounding sodas at the computer)

Mordecai: Yes, I wanna be in a band with you. Alright, but we gotta have a cool band name. What do you think of "Cool Dudes"?

Rigby: "Face Punch."

Mordecai: "Rad 'N' Subtract."

Rigby: "Helicopter Crash."

Mordecai: What about "Mustache Cash Stash"?

Rigby: That's it! That's it!

Mordecai: Order the shirts! Order the shirts!

(The flashback ends)

Mordecai: Oh yeah, T-Shirts.

Rigby: Check it out. Bam! (Pulls out a "Mordecai and the Rigbys" t-shirt)

Mordecai: Mordecai and the Rigbys? What happened to Mustache Cash Stash?

Rigby: I changed it. Awesome, right? (Throws a t-shirt at Mordecai)

Mordecai: But that's just our names. We aren't really going to wear these around, are we?

(Rigby puts on the shirt. Mordecai looks at him disapprovingly)

Margaret: Woah, rad shirts! What are those for?

Rigby: They're for our band.

Margaret: You guys are in a band? "Mordecai and the Rigbys"? That's so cool.

Mordecai: No, no, no, we're not in a band, heh...

Margaret: (skeptically) So, what, it's some sort of fake band?

Mordecai: No, it's a real band, but just... not a big deal, you know?

Margaret: (gasps) Your band should play the open mic tomorrow night. (Hands Mordecai and Rigby a flyer)

Mordecai: Yeah, for sure, uh... totally.

Margaret: Awesome. I can't wait to see you guys play. Well, I guess I'll see you then.

Mordecai: Yeah... see you then... then. (Faceplants on the table)

Rigby: What was that, man?

Mordecai: I don't know! I just didn't want her to think we had a stupid fake band!

Rigby: But now we gotta play that open mic tomorrow!

Mordecai: OK, OK, we can totally do this. We just gotta learn one song by tomorrow night.

Rigby: One song?

Mordecai: One song.

(Cuts to the house. Inside the garage, Mordecai and Rigby turn on their amps, and are shown wielding guitars)

Mordecai: Ready?

Rigby: Shreddy.

Mordecai: One, two, three, four!

(They fumble aimlessly at the strings, producing distorted noise)

Mordecai: OK, stop, stop. We need help.

(Cuts to Pops' room, where Pops is playing a beautiful tune on the harpsichord)

Pops: A two-man ensemble? What a charming idea!

Mordecai: How'd you learn to be so good, Pops?

Pops: Ah-ha! (Rises from the harpsichord bench and pulls out some records from inside. The first is 'How to be a Musician' by 'Sir Geoffrey') Throw these records on the old talking machine and you'll be ready for your open mic in no time!

Mordecai: Agh, you know about the open mic night?

Pops: Yes, everybody knows about it. We're all going to be there!

Mordecai and Rigby: Augh!

(Cuts back to the garage. Rigby places the first record on an old-time gramaphone)

Rigby: Wait. If we're gonna learn this in time, then you gotta take this seriously.

Mordecai: What?

Rigby: Put on the shirt.

Mordecai: Fine. (Puts on his Mordecai and the Rigbys t-shirt) Play the record.

(Rigby winds up the gramaphone and places the needle. A scratchy recording is heard)

Sir Geoffrey: So, you want to become a musician? Bravo! Now, what is the first thing all good musicians require?

Mordecai: Talent?

Sir Geoffrey: Yes! Good personal hygiene is the key to becoming a successful gentleman musician!

Mordecai: (Talks over the record) Augh, this is gonna take like ten years!

Rigby: Yeah, and there's still two more after this one! (Holds up the remaining two records)

Mordecai: There's gotta be a faster way.

Sir Geoffrey: ... all washed up? Good! Now just locate your...

Rigby: All three at once?

(Cuts to Rigby and Mordecai setting three records. Sir Geoffrey talks over himself as they strum badly at their guitars once again)

Sir Geoffrey: (from three speakers)... one, two, three... A minor seventh... Harmonic can be tapped...

Rigby: Dude, this isn't working! I can't understand anything!

Mordecai: Dude, we gotta keep going. Do you wanna look like an idiot at the open mic?

(Mordecai shoves Rigby, who backs into an amp, knocking an opened soda can onto the floor. The soda flows over to power strip on the floor, causing a small electrical fire and plenty of sparks. The power strip explodes, and a bolt of yellow energy flows up through the cables into the gramaphone needles. The gramaphones shoot yellow power through the room and onto the ceiling as Mordecai and Rigby scream. Suddenly the room goes black)

Mordecai: What was that?

(The light re-appears and the room glows yellow, buzzing)

Mordecai: Dude, what's happening?!

Rigby: I don't know!

(The gramaphones levitate into mid air, focus their power into a central ball, spin around, then shoot a focused beam onto the floor. Stylised silhouettes of Mordecai and Rigby appear. The new Mordecai's arm, clad in red, reaches out, and present Mordecai and Rigby's guitars float away towards the new duo)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woah!

(The future Mordecai and Rigby launch into superb guitar solos. Future Mordecai has a goatee and shades, and is dressed somewhat like Michael Jackson; future Rigby has shaved most of his tail, is wearing a flannel shirt and shades, skin-tight black pants, brown boots, and has a pencil thin mustache)

Mordecai and Rigby: Woooaaah...

Mordecai: Dude, who are you guys?

Future Mordecai: (in British accent) We're Mordecai and Rigby. Who the blazes are you?

Mordecai: Uhh...

Future Mordecai: Hah! Just kiddin'. We know who you are. Coz we're you in ten years!

Future Rigby: (in British accent) You don't know it yet, but this is the moment where we teach you how to rock! (Makes metal sign with right hand)

Mordecai: Dude, this is perfect!

Rigby: Wait, wait. We suck, and if you're us, doesn't that mean you suck too?

Future Mordecai: Didn't you just hear us play?

Future Rigby: Yeah, we're super-successful musicians in the future.

Mordecai: Yeah, look at us, dude! We're wearing sunglasses!

Future Mordecai: Our future's so bright, we gotta wear shades.

Rigby: Awesome! Oh, hey, in the future, do we get that thing we always wanted?

Future Rigby: Oh, we got it. (Pulls up shirt to reveal a biting shark tattoo on his armpit, which bites when he moves his arm)

Rigby: Awesome!

Mordecai: Oh, hey, in the future, do I get to go out with Margaret?

Future Mordecai: Huh! (Suggestively) I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise.

Mordecai: Aww.

Future Mordecai: Look. We promise we'll get you ready for tomorrow night's gig if you're willing to put in the work.

Mordecai: Yeah, whatever it takes.

Future Rigby: We said the same thing ten years ago.

Mordecai and Rigby: Awesome!

Future Mordecai: Let's rock!

(A montage shows in which, to the backing of the future Mordecai and Rigby's hit song, they teach the present Mordecai and Rigby all about rock moves and stances. They don't teach them at any time how to actually play an instrument - they practice on brooms and try on new clothes, struggling to walk in their skin-tight pants. The montage ends with future Mordecai and Rigby sitting on the amps applauding their old selves)

Future Mordecai: That's it. You're ready!

Mordecai and Rigby: What?

Mordecai: But we never learned how to play!

Rigby: We haven't even picked up a guitar.

Mordecai: Come on, we got the look, we've got the moves down, I know the lyrics backwards and forwards. Just teach us how to play!

Future Mordecai: Woah, woah, woah! Don't worry. You know enough. You're gonna be fine. Besides, it's too late to teach you anything else. Gig's in 20 minutes.

Mordecai: We're screwed.

(Cuts to the coffee shop exterior, where an excited crowd is going inside. In the coffee shop we see Angel playing a solo piece to wild acclaim. Benson, Skips and Pops enter and take seats)

Angel: (sings) ... You're my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you...

Benson: I can't believe they're gonna play tonight. Those two slackers have never even picked up an instrument. This is gonna be a trainwreck.

Pops: Woo, I love trains!

Angel: (sings) ... my sweet little baby, and I think I might be crazy for you. (song ends to wild applause. Rigby and Mordecai watch from behind a curtain)

Rigby: Dang!

Mordecai: Yeah. (Mordecai walks backstage, holding his stomach and groaning. Rigby picks up a box)

Rigby: Should I hand out the last of the t-shirts?

Mordecai: You brought the t-shirts?

Rigby: Yeah, for the fans.

Mordecai: Dude, we don't even have any fans. (Grabs the box of t-shirts)

(Margaret enters from through the curtain)

Margaret: Oh, wow! You guys look like rock stars. Hey, can I have one of those?

Mordecai: Uh, yeah... (chuckles nervously) Here's a small.

(Margaret struggles to pull on the shirt. Mordecai watches slack-jawed and drops the box. Margaret eventually manages to get the shirt on)

Margaret: How do I look?

Mordecai: (pause) Amazing.

Margaret: I can hand these out for you guys. Get everyone pumped for the closing act.

Mordecai and Rigby: Closing act?

Margaret: Yeah, save the best for last. Well, break a leg, guys. I can't wait.

Announcer: (from through the curtain) And finally, give it up for Mordecai and the Rigbys! Yeah, come on!

(The Future Mordecai and Rigby enter the dressing room)

Future Mordecai: Sorry we're late.

Mordecai: Where've you guys been?

Future Mordecai: We had to get you these. (holds up glowing guitar picks with a lightning motif)

Mordecai: Picks?! But we still don't even know how to play!

Future Mordecai: Just go out there, you'll be great. Just like we were ten years ago.

Mordecai: But...

Future Mordecai: (shoving Mordecai and Rigby through the curtain) Crowd's waitin'! Go on!

(Mordecai and Rigby appear next to the stage. The crowd, dressed in the t-shirts, cheers for them. They take to the stage under the 'OPEN MIC NIGHT' banner. They put on their guitars and plug them into the amps as Mordecai takes the mic)

Mordecai: Uhh...

(Muscle Man is seen at the back of the crowd, standing on his chair and waving his shirt above his head)

Muscle Man: Come on, ladies, play us a tasty lick!

(Mordecai and Rigby look at each other helplessly. Future Rigby motions to Rigby to strum his guitar. Rigby does so and a perfect chord comes out. Mordecai does the same, then they both launch into brilliant lead guitar parts)

Benson: Holy crap!

(Mordecai starts to sing the song)

Mordecai: Your eyes starin' into my eyes, who am I but a guy with two eyes on the prize, and the prize in my eyes is ten times the surprise in your eyes as I kiss you goodnight. / The smile is the fire that lights my soul, gonna remember it until I grow old, cause life's too short, we've gotta do things right, so baby let's just party toni-ight. / Baby, let's just party toni-ight.

(More solos follow, but Mordecai drops his pick. Struggling to lift it up, he hears his guitar part still playing, and his singing part still going, even though he's away from the mic. His guitar, he sees, is plugged into the amp, but the amp isn't plugged into anything.)

Mordecai: (yelling) Rigby!

(Rigby is still rocking out. The crowd cheers as Mordecai waves his arms to stop them.)

Mordecai: No! Augh! (Mordecai sees a CD player at the side of the stage. Future Mordecai and Rigby wave and play air-guitar. Mordecai rushes over and turns off the CD, and the crowd falls silent but for a few calls of "What?")

Rigby: (still playing the unplugged electric guitar, badly) Uhuh! Yeah! Yeah, baby!

Mordecai: You can stop now.

(The crowd boos and heckles)

Mordecai: Wait, wait. I can explain, I can explain! We were lip-synching.

(The crowd boos again. Many throw their t-shirts onto the stage in disgust)

Mordecai: Hey, look, I don't blame you. We thought we could just order some t-shirts and pass ourselves off as a band. But it turns out, playing music's really hard to do. We just got caught up in the dream, man. And just for a little while, it was real. But that's over. And lip-synching's not cool. So we're breaking up the band.

Future Mordecai: (runs onto the stage with Future Rigby) Why'd you stop? It was going great.

Mordecai: You tricked us into lip-synching!

Future Mordecai: Look. We've become rich and famous because of lip-synching. Don't you wanna be a part of that?

Mordecai: (angry) No, that's lame! You may be me, but that's not the me I wanna be.

Rigby: Me neither!

Mordecai: Mordecai and the Rigbys is over. (The two take off their t-shirts. Future Mordecai and Future Rigby begin to fade from view)

Future Mordecai and Future Rigby: Woah, woah!

Future Mordecai: OK, dude. Think about what you're doing.

Future Rigby: Yeah, stop, man!

Future Mordecai: If you break up the band, what are we gonna do in the future?

Mordecai: I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise. (Mordecai starts to rip his t-shirt)

Future Mordecai and Future Rigby: Nooo!

(The t-shirt rips in two. Future Mordecai and Future Rigby explode in a ball of white light, dazzling the crowd. After a moment of shocked silence, Benson rises to his feet and claps. Slowly the rest of the crowd joins in)

Benson: Yeah-heah! Alright!

(The crowd cheers more)

Rigby: I don't know why you thought this open mic would be embarrassing. This is awesome!

Margaret: (waving through the crowd) Mordecai! Mordecai!

Mordecai: (waving back and fighting through) Margaret! Margaret! Margaret!

Margaret: Mordecai!

Mordecai: Margaret!

Margaret: That was pretty cool, what you said up there.

Mordecai: Thanks, Margaret.

Margaret: Oh, hey, have you met my new boyfriend, Angel?

(Mordecai looks stunned)

Angel: C'mon, baby. We don't wanna be late for our (sings) dinner reserva-ations.

Margaret: Oh, yeah. See you, guys! Oh, Angel, you have such a great voice.

(Mordecai and Rigby stand alone)

Rigby: (pause) Maybe you should have just kept lip-synching.
